>*By three methods we may learn wisdom: <br>First, by reflection, which is noblest;<br>Second, by imitation, which is easiest;<br> and third by experience, which is the bitterest.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Confucius__ 

Experience is an edge that cuts both ways.   

We need it to spot unfamiliar variations in otherwise familiar patterns, encouraging us to investigate anomalies deeper. It also helps us intuitively make decisions without deep analysis, often accurately. 

Experience can also harden perspectives in place and prevent us from seeing what's obvious to onlookers. Gary Klein's research on insights uncovered four key aspects to discovering insights, one of which is experience in the field. I would like to posit that the other three factors play a role in the value of experience, either amplyfing its effectiveness or diminishing it, sometimes even making it work against your goal: 

* An active stance over a passive one, looking past the surface even when a reasonable answer presents itself. Sometimes information presents itself that changes the very goal we set out for, but we are so focused on the original goal that we look past it and fail to adapt our path. 
* A playful reasoning style over a concrete one, willing to go on tangents and think creatively about aspects of the problem, even if the thoughts don't seem relevant in the moment. Exploring various possibilities keeps us open to unintuitive information and helps us break out of the structured patterns of thinking experience can form. 
* A fixation with a flawed belief or erroneous facts can prevent us from seeing new information from a fresh perspective. We have to be careful not to let experience become an excuse for arrogance on facts or opinions. We especially have to be careful about the things we consider objective, as time and time again in the past data that were taken for granted turned out to be measured on a flawed basis, so even what we consider facts today may have a basis to be disproven tomorrow. 

While it's important to have an open mindset, an attitude of questioning curiosity can uncover insights too. When something feels off, investigate it rather than dismissing it, and the thread just might lead somewhere. Even if it doesn't, you will likely learn from the pursuit. 

Above all it's important we put our past experience into perspective and consider the many ways it could be clouding our judgement for the present or the future, often two drastically different times from the past.
