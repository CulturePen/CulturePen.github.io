There's something that makes many of us afraid to really dive deep into our interests and end up with any combination of the following:

* An encyclopedic knowledge of the subject.
* A tendency to babble excitedly when the subject comes up or when we have an interested listener. 
* A seemingly infinite well of energy to draw from when it comes to learning/doing/teaching the subject. 
* An obsessive need to connect with others who care even a little bit about the subject we've come to love. 
* An attachment to those who care just as much as we do.

There are plenty of us who could end up being this way about something by diving deep into something we enjoy, but we don't. Some reasons why we might hold back: 

* It's not a normal career. 
* It's not a normal hobby.
* It's one of the above, but it's not normal to go deeper than necessary to do your job/have the hobby. 
* We're not getting paid to dive deep. 
* We're not paying to dive deep.
* We can imagine that diving deep might change us in ways that distance us from others. Perhaps from those we care about.  
* Nobody else will care, so why try? 

What would it take for you to be able to pursue your interests obsessively rather than suppressing them? Finding a niche you enjoy doesn't only mean going where it's hard to go. You also have the option of going where it's *weird* to go. It's risky without permission and without a guide. But today there are guides for many, many niches, widely available through the internet. Obscure communities that could not have existed 30 years ago. 

Permission on the other hand isn't something anyone else can grant you. Nobody's going to issue you a license to dive deeply into something, although some people might say they can. Ultimately it's up to you what you choose to explore and how deeply you choose to go. Just don't hold back because it's dark and murky past a certain depth. You can always find a flashlight or a group of people to dive alongside you, but you have to decide to take the plunge first.
