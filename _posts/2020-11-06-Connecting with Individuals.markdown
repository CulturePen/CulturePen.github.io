What is it that makes us difficult to connect to a group of people with the same compassion and openness we might offer a single individual in front of us? If someone says something controversial or divisive in person, we might be curious at first to see how they came to that idea. We might engage them in in discussion or ask some questions before deciding if they're clearly opposed to us or "wrong" in any specific way. We might exert more empathy to understand their life story, how their views were shaped, and the situation they find themselves in right now from their own perspective. We might even question our own idea that conflicts with theirs and consider potential flaws or gaps in our understanding. 

There's something that makes this process difficult to do with large, abstract groups of people, such as political groups, religious groups, or even the group of people who like pineapple on pizza vs. those who dislike pineapple on pizza. In some cases we're able to joke about it without much fear of repercussion, like with the pineapple on pizza group, but in many cases these differences in groups ends up transcending our personal openness to connect with and learn about someone. The story of Daryl Dixon and his long-term, curiosity driven endeavour with the KKK is a fascinating example of what can happen when people interact as complex, curious individuals rather than as representations of their conflicting ideologies. It took a significant amount of time and effort for Daryl, and he didn't *expect* the results he ended up having, with KKK members giving up their robes and leaving the Klan. He went into the process genuinely interested in how the KKK could have formed its views, and in the process he befriended members of the Klan in a meaningful way. Not as part of a sting operation, and not disinggenuously. These were real, genuine, mutually engaging relationships. 

What is it that makes this kind of approach seem so repulsive? Especially when we consider applying it to the most harmful viewpoint or ideology we can think of today? Ultimately everyone who believes something is a human being with their own circumstances, background story, family relationships, and interests in learning and progress. I could imagine that if Daryl went to a friend at some point to discuss his plan ahead of time, he might have been warned not to do it or perhaps laughed at. I don't think many people would have understood why he wanted to do it or what good could possibly come out of it. Often these kinds of outcomes only happen because people set out to do something out of curiosity rather than specific results, or out of a desire to be understood by and to understand another human being. 

We all regularly have the choices in front of us to consider this path. It's not always the right path, but it's increasingly becoming a less-trodden one. Each of us can change that for ourselves if we choose to.
