>*The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Daniel J. Boorstin__, *Washington Post Interview, January 29, 1984* 

Consider this perspective: Work isn't meant to fulfill, only to provide for your financial needs. Of course, if you manage to enjoy it, that's a bonus! But you find those days rarer as pressure mounts to deliver results on time for deadlines. You find the work challenging, but the environment holding you back sometimes. You feel like you could be doing more at times, but you're encouraged to avoid mistakes and frowned upon when you experiment with new methods. Your boss pats you on the back and says, "Good job this quarter," which is exactly what he did and said last quarter, when you delivered the same results.

The real joy in your life comes from your time outside of work, the time you spend with your family, friends, and community. You work hard and give of yourself well and find social connection in the weekend picnics and dinner parties. Every year you take a well deserved trip with your family to a new place, proud of your children's growth as they take in new sights and experiences each year. You're passionate about helping the local homeless population, so you donate to a local charity and volunteer your time at the soup kitchen every Tuesday and Thursday evening, although on particularly exhausting workdays you push your shift back to the weekend instead. You've come to know many of the people you help well, and find that they come to you for advice and trust you. At times, their unique perspectives enable insights in your own life for which you find yourself grateful. You find that you trust them too and enjoy the close connection you share. Overall, you feel contentment with life. 

This is the perspective I grew up with, the life I expected to build for myself.

Now consider another perspective: Work is as fulfilling as the time you spend outside of it, just in a different way. You trust your colleagues and boss(es) and feel trusted by them in return. You know that their caring for you extends beyond the workplace, and you feel the same. Your work matters, and when it feels like it doesn't, you feel free to bring that up and change it to make it so. You come home from work inspired to be a better human being, and you find your work fuelling your energy in life. Conflict in the workplace is open and healthy, and you feel safe to bring your whole self to work. It's not just what you do that fulfills you so much, but how you do it and the way it feels to belong to something bigger than yourself. You never feel like you have to compromise your values to get a job done, and you always find that there is support when you're struggling, no matter how small or personal the struggle may be. 

This is the perspective I've begun to learn of recently. I've been told it's unrealistic to expect this, that the world doesn't work that way. Maybe that's true. If so, what's stopping us from making it true? Is it because we're human? Or is it our very humanity that makes any of this possible to imagine in the first place? Perhaps it is our ability to understand the very flaws that riddle our thinking and transcend our past behaviour to design the future we want to live. But we've become jaded by what we see as reality, fear and doubt holding us back until we don't just accept the world we've created. We begin to defend it and truly believe that it is the only way, that to strive for more would be futile and cost us our security and safety, while resulting in nothing but failure and anguish. 

This has been my paradigm shift. 

I chose to suspend disbelief for a moment and really consider what I wanted. Is it true that you have to choose between fulfilling work and a safe, secure, happy life? Are we so convinced that we must trade success to pursue this ideal that we aren't willing to see how real it can be to build both? I suppose there are many ways to find out, but my path is to commit to it fully. By expecting and settling for nothing less, I hope to find, or create, this ideal. If I'm doomed to fail, then so be it. Succeeding at anything less would be my only truly regrettable failure.
