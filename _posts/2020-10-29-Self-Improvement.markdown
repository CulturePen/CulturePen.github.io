Any sort of progress has to start with you. There are plenty of inspiring people and situations out there, and plenty of people who aren't inspired or changed by them. Maybe you find yourself in similar situations and wonder what's going wrong. I know I have. To be inspired by a situation is a choice one can make. To remain inspired is also a choice, and to convert some inspiration into action and change is a choice. You will fail at times, but failing to choose is the easiest kind of failure use as an excuse or cover-up. Not trying at all, doing nothing slightly risky, unsafe, or uncertain... is the only guaranteed recipe for long-term failure. Certain decisions just make the rest of life more hassle-free. 

Choosing to be honest leads to connecting with more honest people, especially when you start to notice dishonesty and decide not to put up it. Choosing to be grateful leads to seeing more opportunities to appreciate people and things, and more ways to help others. Lapses are normal too. It's okay to have unkind or dishonest moments if you're willing to notice and learn from them. The choice to be better over time means that there is no state that calls for permanent failure. Self-improvement becomes a constant choice, a consistent fork in the road. Anything you come across that seems useful, try applying it immediately. Try testing a new way of thinking or being or acting and see how it works for you. Change is a constant choice you get to make for yourself. Any improvement necessarily requires some change.
