>*There's no such thing as writer's block. What that is is performance anxiety that you've imposed on yourself because your expectations are too high. Just lower your standards. Lower your standards until you get started.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Neil Strauss (as quoted by Tim Ferriss)__, [*Impact Theory Interview*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYU-8IFcDPw 'Impact Theory Interview')

I've been expecting far too much from myself. So much so that I've been underdelivering on my promises. The further I fell behind, the more I expected to deliver to "catch up", and so the less likely I was to actually sit down and write what I was going through. 

For whatever reason, it was coming across this quote that broke me out of that spiral. I thought I had gotten past this when I wrote that my blog is simply an open journal, with no expectations for what that meant to the outside world. But clearly I still held expectationsâ€”ones that paralyzed me.

It feels great to write again. So much so that I wonder why it was so hard to simply do so, even though the answers are all laid out in front of me. It's interesting how I functioned, feeling guilty for acting in ways I perfectly understood as human and natural. 

I've learnt a lot about myself over the last month, perhaps more than the entire year before that combined, and it's been an unintuitive, exhausting process that has somehow energized me more than anything before. Much of what I've learnt has brought on this strange sense of peace with the world, where I don't feel as apt to complain or blame anymore. Rather my focus has been on aspiring to the positive aspects of our growth as a species, such as the fact that in a mere century we've almost doubled our life expectancy in from 49 years to the low 80s now. Or this nugget of information I came across from Gary Vaynerchuk that put things into perspective for me: The current approximate odds of a human life developing is about 400 trillion to one. To compare, the odds of winning the lottery are about 28 million to one. There's almost nothing that could happen in our lives that could rival the sheer ridiculousness of the miracle that *is* our life. 

It feels like everything I've absorbed and understood over the last month has put me in the right mindset to learn from the world with fresh eyes. It feels impossible to judge anymore; my perspective is just one in billions and they're all perfectly reasonable. I'm excited for tomorrow evening when I'll be attending my first training with the Big Brother organization here in Vancouver. If all goes well, I'll go on to participate in a few workshops and learn from some unique kids and their perspectives. Hopefully I can inspire them in ways I haven't understood yet!
