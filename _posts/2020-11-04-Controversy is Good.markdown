What's the alternative? That everyone accepts the way things are and nothing can be improved? Controversy opens up discussion, means people are speaking up, and at the very least is a chance for improvement. It's impossible to please everyone and exhausting to try to always be on the right side of contentious social issues. The amount of pressure exerted on agreeing to certain moral views or just being condemned as immoral means that free, open discussion isn't really free or open. Things can't improve if people can't air their views honestly. If people have to suppress how they think or feel just to fit in and feel safe in society, that's not a permanent solution. That's not the kind of solution we'd want to settle for 200 or 500 years from now, so it's not the kind of solution we should want to settle for today. I'd much rather people feel free to be honest with the outside world and change their ideas and views for positive reasons they find compelling. Someone conforming out of fear or shame isn't really changing in a way that's beneficial to society in the long run. 

People avoiding open discourse out of a vague, unspoken fear is just one side-effect of the kind of culture that shouts people down. Individual choice enables people to co-exist peacefully even when they disagree, and even find ways to mutually benefit despite disagreements. The option to speak one's mind freely enables people to change their mind and change other people's minds too. Suppressing controversy, steering away from it, fearing it, only means saying and thinking stuff that's bland and meaningless. It's relatively easy to figure out (over time) how to fit into a crowd, say what you think people want to hear, and fit the mould. Much harder to figure out what you care about, what you want, and who you plan to be, regardless of controversy or conflict. Avoiding controversy or disagreement when you think it's about a meaningful issue isn't respectful. It's disrespectful because to avoid civil and contentious discussion with a person or group of people is to assume they are definitely wrong and definitely incapable of convincing you of better ideas, or incapable of changing their own ideas to be better.

Far too many thoughts and opinions and ideas go unspoken, unwritten, unshared, sometimes even unthought because of fear or the idea of "Who am I to think or say or write that?". If we value diversity of ideas, then we should be willing to be curious about the very ideas that make us angry or scared. To only value a diversity of ideas that make us feel good isn't the way to a better future, because our feelings change for the better too. Controversy and conflict and inconsistency, and adddresing those things, is exactly how we move forward. Losing sight of that in any given moment, argument, or current event is to lose sight of what makes civilizations grow in the first place.
