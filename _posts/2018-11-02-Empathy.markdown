A growing body of research suggests that we may NOT be wired for survival and self-protection as a first instinct, but rather that our most base instinct is a need to *belong*, an empathic drive to fit in as part of a community of social beings. The picture above is from an eye-opening [animated talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7AWnfFRc7g "RSA Animate: The Empathic Civilization") by the RSA called The Empathic Civilisation. Empathy is deeply ingrained in the way our brains work and it's been a large contributing factor to our survival as a species. The research mentioned in the talk touches upon the finding of mirror neurons in our brains, and that of most primates; neurons that give us the ability, but also the obligation, to empathize. When we observe someone experiencing any emotional situation, whether positive or negative, our mirror neurons fire off as if we're experiencing the very same event. It's why we're able to genuinely say things like, *"I feel happy for you."* When that's genuine empathy, it's not just a reaction to someone's happiness, but an actual sharing of that experience as if it's happening directly *to* us.

Another interesting idea posited in the talk is that empathy could not exist in utopia or heaven; that empathy is very grounded in our human understanding and experience of suffering and our own mortality. It's what enables us to see someone flourish and celebrate with them, or to see them suffer and want to help them flourish. If everyone was genuinely fulfilled and life was perfect, empathy wouldn't exist. The choice we get to make over the course of our lifetimes is how large we choose to make our circle of empathy. Culturally our circle of empathy has grown over time. Think about all the things we do for family without a second thought, because they're family. For a long time the circle of empathy was limited to blood ties and direct family. Then it was about tribes, communities, and eventually nations and arbitrary denominations like skin colour, gender, or political views. If we're being honest, even the delineation of family is fairly arbitrary, but it is very culturally ingrained in us to view these arbitrary boundaries we set as meaningful ones. It's what enables us to trust and feel trusted, to sacrifice and feel good about it. 

It's a perpetual choice we make every moment who we choose to include in that circle of empathy and who we choose to exclude. Unfortunately, it isn't always a conscious choice, and we don't always realize that when we scapegoat someone outside of our circle of empathy, we hurt ourselves too. The biggest mistake we're taught to make over and over again is to believe that our capacity to love and empathize is limited. That we need to save it for those closest to us, for those most like us, and for those we feel will pay us back best. It's always been arbitrary, but it doesn't have to be. Empathy is one of the most intrinsically rewarding traits of ours and it is not limited by our money, time, or energy. It's only limited by the choice we're conditioned to make. It's also fuelled by the choice we can learn to make instead; to look out for every living being and genuinely care, not because we have to, but because we want to. The world may tell us it's a naive choice, one that doesn't work in today's dog-eat-dog world. I don't believe that anymore, and you don't have to either. 

End of the day, you get to choose what's meaningful to you. So does every other person out there. The least we can do is be conscious of that and realize that everybody's right. When we empathize, it no longer becomes about imposing our perspective on someone else, but sharing it with them and partaking equally of theirs too. It no longer becomes about possessing ideas and opinions but rather trying them on for size and building a wardrobe of understanding filled with varying perspectives. Everyone has good reasons to believe what they do; if we can't see them yet, it's because we don't want to choose to look closely enough.
