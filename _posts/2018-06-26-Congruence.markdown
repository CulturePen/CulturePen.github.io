>>*If I didn’t take people where they hired me to take them, I wouldn’t expect them to get back on my bus. We expect leaders to take us where we want to go. The problem, it seems to me, begins when they don’t. When things do not improve and yet these leaders keep expecting us to get back on their bus. I think this is when leaders become something else: Politicians.*

When was the last time you made a commitment to someone, including yourself, and then kept it? How did it feel?

Congruence is having no gap between your words and your actions, between who you aspire to be and who you are every day. On the other hand, a lack of congruence invites guilt, doubt and regret as you find yourself living a life that doesn’t make you happy, a life that doesn’t reflect who you feel you really are. 

One of the quickest ways to build congruence is to make commitments and keep them. Especially commitments to yourself, because when no one else is watching and you’re both the promiser and the promised to, when you can release yourself from your oath anytime, that is when keeping your commitments builds the most congruence. 

A congruent person trusts themselves, and is trusted by others. They may be liked or disliked, but they are always respected for who they are, because their intentions and actions are always one. Their agendas are never doubted for long.

I’m not a very congruent person. Not right now anyway. So it’s time to change that. 

The first commitment I set was writing this blog every day, which has been a great source of consistent inspiration and growth. 

My second commitment is this: To give myself the opportunity to fail meaningfully every day. To take risks and be genuine to myself, and in doing so invite the risk of being wrong, or causing short-term harm. If less than half  the opinions I share on this blog turn out to be wrong or misinformed or ill-conceived, then I will have truly failed myself and you. I will have neglected to take enough risks, to experiment boldly enough with myself and the world to share truly new, untested ideas. 

And that’s the only kind of failure I choose to fight every day. The failure of being too careful, the failure of doubt, worry and sanity. The world has never been changed by people doing what has worked well for others in the past.

The world has always been changed by thoughtful people seeking to be proven wrong so that they could grow, and in turn contribute meaningfully to the world’s collective growth.
