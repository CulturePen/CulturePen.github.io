There's something interesting about noticing discomfort or angst in myself. There's a period before that moment of noticing where I was uncomfortable or angsty (fearful or anxious) without knowing it. Sometimes noticing causes the feeling to dissipate or at least become less of a driver of my actions, but other times it just makes it harder to act. It becomes this obstacle that I feel compelled to track while I'm trying to do something, and it can grow into a kind of self-doubt that directly or indirectly kills the act. The direct kind of death is one I can be honest with myself about: I consciously know that I'm failing to act out of fear or something else. The indirect kind is more insidious, but something I've been gaining a better awareness of gradually (making it direct). With the indirect kind of death of an act, I just distract myself under the pretense of doing something related or simply taking a break from something difficult. It's the dishonesty to myself that makes this a problem, because in the process I end up failing to act anyway, but I also get to feel like I didn't really fail. I get to blame something else instead of taking responsibility for the outcome of not following through with what I was doing. 

That pattern of not taking responsibility for an outcome, especially in such an indirect, dodgy way, lets me off the hook and makes it likely I'll make the same kind of mistake again. I've been trying to figure out and experiment with ways to make progress on this problem of discomfort/angst, action, and avoidance. One of them has been to try sitting with the problem, and the emotion, without any expectation of making progress directly. The only expectation I set is that I can't escape the emotion until it naturally subsides. If I find myself distracted by other thoughts, or tempted to go read something or check my phone, I take note of that and try to keep focused on the task at hand. A challenge with this is that sitting with those emotions is significantly harder than finding a way to avoid them. But in the process I seem to come across new perspectives on the problem and improve my ability to focus on something and try to diagnose the cause of the emotion, even while feeling it. 

I'm starting to think these emotions aren't necessarily inevitable or out of my control to affect. They can be influenced, shaped, modified, but it's going to depend on the choices I make. So whether I act anyway and force myself through the emotion, or just sit with the emotion itself and try to understand it... It seems like the only long-term losing choice is to avoid it forever. If I find myself avoiding something forever, it seems like that might be worth digging into and laying out against my other priorities. Generally it seems like progress comes from those difficult moments where I choose to think or spend my attention differently than usual. 

Angst in action might even be a sign I'm on the right path. Instead of running from it, it can be worth finding a way in that general direction towards whatever is difficult rather than towards what's easy or comforting.
