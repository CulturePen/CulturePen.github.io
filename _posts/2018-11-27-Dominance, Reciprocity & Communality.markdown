I watched this fascinating RSA Animated talk given by Steven Pinker on the subject of [Language as a Window into Human Nature.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-son3EJTrU "RSA Animate - Language as a Window into Human Nature"). At one point he speaks about the findings of Alan Fiske, an anthropologist who found that all human interactions fall into one of three categories: Dominance, Reciprocity, and Communality. Dominance is characterized by commands and obedience, a *don't mess with me* kind of attitude. It's the kind of relationship some of us may have with our bosses or even our spouses at times. 

Reciprocity is characterized by a mutual exchange, sort of like *you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.* This is the kind of relationship we often have with businesses, business partners or when we negotiate for something, especially when finances are involved. 

Communality is characterized by sacrifice and helping others without an expectation of return. This is the kind of mutualism that we often have with our family and close friends. Interesting things occur when there's a misunderstanding about the type of relationship, and it's why we can feel awkward at times when we aren't sure how to act in a certain situation.

 What I've realized personally is that I've begun to seek mutualism and communality in nearly every relationship of mine, including in my search for a company. I tie that kind of bond heavily to forming a genuine human connection with someone and I now understand that many of the relationships I formed at my last workplace were very communal. In a way my subconscious approach to them ended up shaping them that way. We actually have a high degree of control over the kinds of relationships we form, whether we realize it or not. When we go into a relationship expecting to sacrifice with no opaque expectations, we will often find that others will do the same for us. This is because we're very sensitive to the kind of interaction we form and others can sense when we genuinely care about them and aren't just doing things for them for our benefit or out of a reciprocal expectation. It's why I genuinely believe I can find (or form) a company or team that operates this way, because it's definitely in our control to make it so.
