What's the most extreme thing you want to do? You don't have to go do it, but maybe it's a question worth answering. What is it that sometimes feels so safe about middle ground desires and decisions? Maybe that we don't have to take responsibility for them going exactly as expected. Can't complain if a boring approach gets a boring result. 

Now what about being extremely boring? So extremely average and typical that it's abnormal and extraordinary? That would be interesting, and certainly not average. If nobody is average, then setting out to be average is itself an act of extremism. So if you want to do something safe and stable, how would you do it extremely safely and stably? What would that look like? 

The stereotypes we have about safety and stability are broken anyway. [This random hypothetical accountant likes to go mountain-climbing.](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/ca/resources/firm-management/accounting-firm-sabbatical-program-work-life-balance/#main:~:text=A%20sabbatical%20program%20is%20also%20a,as%20well%20as%20her%20mountain%2Dclimbing%20dream. "Quickbooks Kilimanjaro") Stability as we usually know it isn't very stable in an ever-changing world. Most jobs aren't stable because most industries are changing significantly by the decade. Stability is overrated when it relies on people and culture remaining unchanged. 

Extremism enables us to embark on the pursuits on which we know plenty of people might discourage us. Not only are these pursuits fulfilling, they're also scarce to the world. Someone that pursues something so untenable and risky that it's not a common life path is also building themselves to be an uncommon person. Scarcity and uniqueness are rewarded if we choose to invest in the pursuits that build towards them. These extreme pursuits do not need to be large, but they do need to be discomforting to plenty of people. If a pursuit isn't disconcerting or internally conflicting, how extreme is it really? If it doesn't make some part of you initially ask, "Why would you do that?", it's not extreme. 

The best part about extremism is that you get to define the axes. You can be extreme in any way you please, on any number and specific kind of dimensions you please. With enough dimensions, even aiming to be at the smack dab centre of them will be an extreme act. Everybody stands out in some way and you can choose which facets of yourself you want to amplify. By definition we pick the safe and comfortable choice for the vast majority of our decisions, so it's important to choose your extreme pursuits intentionally. Make them a part of the process by which you consider a life well lived. I doubt a boring life is one worth living, but it has to be judged by your standards.
