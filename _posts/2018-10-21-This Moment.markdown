There has never been a better day, age, or moment more conducive to being open, genuine, and unique than the very one you are living in right now. The world has never been a more rewarding environment for those that seek to understand each other and to create meaning in their every thought and interaction. The freedom we have is no longer just external—it never has been—and this moment is the most rewarding to feeling that freedom deep within your being. 

Courage exists right alongside fear, depending on it the same way a shadow depends on the presence of a light source. To extinguish fear is to extinguish courage; but to ally with fear, to welcome it as a sign that you're on the right path and to dance with it is to foster the courage it takes to unleash your internal freedom on the external world. 

Something beautiful takes place when this happens; you give your deepest desires a voice. You give your subconscious a seat at the table right alongside your conscious and a remarkable sense of alignment clicks into place. You are no longer just the conscious you, fighting the battle of overcoming your laziness, your cruelty, your anxiety and your judgments. You embrace all facets of yourself without judgment and the congruent wholeness that you feel makes you one with everything you previously shunned. 

The outcasts come in out of the cold, warm themselves by the fire, and share their stories, stories that we used to toss aside before we even heard them, and around that campfire there is a sense of peace, of tranquility, of a bond and trust immeasurable and unbreakable. 

It's an indescribable feeling but a wonderful experience. I'm still working on figuring out how I seem to have stumbled upon this congruent state of being. The nice thing is I can enjoy it without needing to understand it, while still progressing towards that understanding naturally over time.
