Putting a single idea in a post and exploring it well is difficult for me. It's something I'm going to start trying out. For this post, the single idea will be: **One idea explored well is better than ten ideas explored poorly.**

Ideas are fragile in their infancy. Ideas that look bad on the surface often aren't terrible when explored further. It's possible to explore an idea quickly and discard it in favour of another one. But that skill is built first by exploring ideas well, even if that takes time and energy. One of the ways it can be difficult is because it means sticking with an idea even when the people around you think it's a bad one. One easy mistake to make is assuming that naysayers with good intent aren't going to lead you astray. Of course they can, even if they don't mean to. If you want to explore something different, you aren't going to get much support from people who've given up on exploring. Explore the idea enough to exercise your own judgment confidently. It's fine to be wrong about your initial impression of the idea, **but it's not fine to leave the idea unexplored if you're going to regret it**. Consider seriously whether you'll regret it a year, or five years, from now. The acts we regret aren't often things we did, but usually things we didn't do. 

Explore that idea. Sometimes that means saying something you've been holding back on saying. Sometimes it means reading more, or building something to see how that process goes. Exploring an idea means avoiding hiding from it. I'm most comfortable reading about lots of different ideas, and most uncomfortable actually putting them into action. Think of exploring an idea like pioneering. There has to be some danger, some risk, some uncertainty. If I know that I'll feel safe and comfortable reading something, am I really exploring? The ideas that are worth exploring are the ones that make you feel a little uneasy but also excite you. You want to see what'll happen. So make it happen.  

Appreciation goes to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/1idea "Derek Sivers - Shine A Spotlight On One Idea At a Time) for inspiring me to explore being a monomaniac with my blog posts. I don't follow the same process of writing lots and then cutting things, but this experiment might be my first step there.
