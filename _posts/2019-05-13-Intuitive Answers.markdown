Uncovering the truth often relies on spotting flaws in conventional wisdom and facing uncomfortable notions to flip it on its head. It's rarely intuitive until all the pieces are put together, but once you're past that stage you're left wondering how you could never see it before. When we go out looking for the unintuitive, we are implicitly questioning our default patterns of observation and reasoning. Taken for granted, these patterns can blind us to reality so strongly that the lies we tell ourselves seem obvious and well built. Part of this falls under the belief bias, where our willingness to accept a reasoned conclusion is dependant on how believable the conclusion is, rather than the strength of the reasoning behind it. 

Belief bias is one of the most self-deceptive kinds because it's easy to view a believable or intuitive conclusion as being well-reasoned or logical without doing the work of running through the reasoning ourselves. We miss out on potential chances to rewrite flawed patterns in our belief systems. One way around this is questioning conclusions that seem too easy to believe. We can double check the reasoning behind beliefs we want to accept when we realize that they fall neatly within the reality we want to be true. Evidence doesn't lie but we lie to ourselves about the subjective meaning evidence holds all the time.
