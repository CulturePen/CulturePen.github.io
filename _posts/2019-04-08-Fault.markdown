I was having a conversation with a friend today when an interesting perspective came up. This idea that we're taught to feel like fault is bad. We naturally rationalize that negative interactions were partially our fault, and partially their fault, thereby avoiding the bulk of the guilt we would feel if we took 100% responsibility. The more a negative interaction with someone else was my fault, the worse I feel thinking about it later. What if we flipped that thinking though? I walked him through this idea I had on the spot, which was that fault is actually good. If I had a falling out with someone I cared about and I realized it was 100% my fault, then that also means that I would entirely capable of fixing it. If they were 50% at fault, and I was only 50% at fault, then even if I changed by behaviour completely, we would still have 50% of a problem. So when we're able to take responsibility and realize how our behaviour makes it easy for others to react negatively in ways that we blame them for, we can fix our patterns and entirely solve problems that we didn't realize we could.
