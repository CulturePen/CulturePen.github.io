This isn't the same as giving up responsibility, agency, or influence. It's not about giving up the desire or ability to strive for more. We have plenty of opportunities to exercise those. 

Control is about absolute predictability. It's rigid and inflexible. Expecting to have control over outcomes is an eventual and continual recipe for disappointment. The faster circumstances change, the more control is subverted and adaptability is rewarded. In circumstances where change is slow to take place, control can look like a viable goal. But when control becomes the goal, it expands into a lifestyle and an expectation. Our natural state is one of progess and change, and expecting control only slows that down. It encourages the setting up of fixed targets in world that's always moving, and continually encourages the illusion of a fixed world. 

When one learns to be stable without control, no amount of change has to be a shock to expectations. When one looks for control, one often finds merely the illusion of it. The illusion of control extends into relationships, careers, and entire methods of planning. Once one finds control in one area of life, it's natural to seek it in others too. Even the most stable situations one can imagine are subject to change. True, unwavering stability has to be built outward from inner character. The paradox there is that relinquishing control increases inner stability.   

By taking responsibility for outcomes while relinquishing control, we set ourselves up to continually change in ways that we didn't think possible before. Disruption isn't so jarring anymore. Unexpected changes become welcome friends rather than adversaries.
