Many there are. Few I keep. Damages abound and litigation is fierce.<br>
Motions are filed and appeals are dismissed. No winner is clear.<br>
Onlookers gasp but they're never surprised. The drama sparks conflict but never progress.<br> 
The plaintiff is relentless and pushy. The defendant is creative and dodgy.<br>
No settlement in sight and the judge is tired. A staunch professional, she shows up to every trial date regardless. 
Losses pile up and settle like a smog, slowly spreading to even the most positive of onlookers.<br>
Conflict drags on for years and the participants begin to wither, but nobody wants to give up.<br>
Giving up is the only bad kind of loss, rationalize.<br>
Better to fight and lose than to never fight at all, they romanticize.<Br>

Legal battles are stressful, but I'm having them with myself all the time. I'm constantly either trying to enforce or avoid contractual responsibilities. They're contracts I've drafted, signed, and stamped myself. Nobody forced me to sign them, and nobody is enforcing them but me. Fighting to both avoid and enforce old contracts is exhausting, so why do I keep doing it? Why not re-write the contracts and try to make them better? Why exactly am I fighting myself?

<hr>
Someone speaks up and questions the suit. "Is this case making anyone's life better?"<Br>
People groan and mumble but no one objects to the question.<br>
No one answers it either.<br>
Silence hangs in the air, threatening to stifle people even more than the smog of loss.<br>
"Just a few more weeks and we'll know!" blurts someone from the audience. <br>
The judge reaches for her gavel to bring order back to the courtroom, but order never lived there with this case.<br>
People lined up neatly and taking their turns to contribute to their own misery. <br>
The appearance of order scaffolded by the inner workings of a chaotic, directionless fear.<br>
Harried and exhausted, she hesitates and decides against it. <br>
That moment of hesitation is enough to interrupt the underlying thread of fear. <br>
The plaintiff steps out, walks across the aisle, leans over, and whispers defendant's ear. <br>
He seeks no permission or reassurance from his lawyer or the judge. <br>
No furtive glances to check if his movements have the sanction of those present <br>
A single-minded focus that surprises himself, driven by action before thought.<br>
Nobody stops him.

HT: Naval's ["Desire is a constract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want."](https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/every-desire-is-a-chosen-unhappiness?rq=desire#block-5ccfb2c149814773a3ce:~:text=Desire%20is%20a%20contract%20you%20make,I%E2%80%99ve%20chosen%20to%20be%20unhappy.%20%5B5%5D "Desire is a contract") Perhaps these contracts with myself are similar engines of unhappiness. Is that how I want to burn my fuel?
