David Deutsch writes that *moral philosophy is the problem of what to do next*. I've been contemplating how I should shape my moral values towards life, as in the past I mostly just followed whatever felt natural, but I've realized just how many opportunities I've missed out on to embody better values and live a better life. For the longest time I've held this implicit, hidden assumption that prioritizing moral values would cost me something. Now I'm beginning to realize the subtle cost of living on autopilot. I grew up with this notion that considering or questioning one's moral values is taboo, and changing them constantly is even more unfathomable. However I've been coming upon better and better ways to improve my moral values, and I've learnt that such progress is unbounded. There's nothing stopping me from continually improving my moral values, as long as I'm willing to criticize them consistently and keep seeking better ways to contribute to the wellbeing of the world. 

The effective altruism movement is particularly interesting in how it has brought together two distinct human drives: Our intuitive compassion and desire to help others, and our deep desire for truth and objectivity. Combining what has traditionally been a very personal and subjective process with rigorous community error-correction, strong ethical and philosophical roots of reason & rationality, and a commitment to questioning prevailing methods of thought and decision making seems to have given it a great moral and social reach. Peter Singer's ethical arguments are very convincing and the problems of which we are made aware inspire us to be better people. I wonder why it sometimes feel like bettering oneself for the sake of others is far more driving a force than if one's betterment was only for self-serving reasons. 

Ultimately with enough thought placed on the matter, it becomes natural for me to realize just how lucky I am to live in a beautiful, first-world city and be spoiled for choice on options of what to do with my life and to have the freedom to safely pursue meaning and fulfillment rather than just survival. The cliche would be to say that the least I can do is give back, when really it's starting to feel like meaningful fulfillment and contributing to the betterment of the world effectively are inextricably entwined. With moral progress being unbounded, the last thing I want to do is accept my historic moral status quo.
