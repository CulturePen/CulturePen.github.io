Today was an interesting day. It was the first time that I thought that I might actually be good at helping people understand themselves. All the steady yet unstructured learning over the past two years seemed to culminate in this practical empathy and understanding of the person in front of me. I was able to push past distractions and problems that would have fully engaged me before and instead reach right for the root issue that was linked to all of these symptoms. I was able to see how the person was deceiving themselves and rather than judging them, I was able to show them in a way that enabled them to question what had so long been unquestionable for them. 

Until today I hadn't really been aware of who I was becoming. Change-blindness kept me from noticing the small, incremental shifts in my attitude and perception, until the insights I pulled out today made it startlingly clear to everyone in the room that something was different about me. The sense of focus and flow, free of judgment and fear, was exhilirating. Seeing understanding grow in someone's eyes as they examined the deepest parts of themselves was also indescribably fulfilling. If this is what I get to do for the rest of my life, I would be more than satisfied. It's time to find a way to put it to use helping people.
