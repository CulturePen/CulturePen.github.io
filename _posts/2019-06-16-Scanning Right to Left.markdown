An old investigator trick is to look over a crime scene from right to left. For English speakers who are used to reading left to right, this forces the observer to pay attention to what they see rather than fall into their habitual pattern of putting together the shapes to fit what we expect to see. Scanning right to left takes more work and is uncomfortable, but it catches more details and better connects the observer with reality rather than their expectations. 

We spend the vast majority of our lives in our default, energy-efficient mode, approaching every new situation by scanning it left to right. It's familiar, feels comfortable and drains us the least. We make the judgments that come easiest and we warp reality to fit what we expect it to be rather than what it is. To scan right to left is to question our beliefs, our assumptions, and the judgments we take for granted. It is to ask, "Why do I want to believe this?" as much as it is to ask, "Why don't I want to believe the opposite?"
