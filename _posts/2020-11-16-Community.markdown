We're all a part of different communities. Families, internet communities, work teams, friend groups and so on. The communities we spend time in influence how we change over time. How we balance our time and energy between them is up to us, so it's worth asking why we spend time in communities. Some family dynamics can involve shame and guilt, making it seem like we have to participate just to avoid feeling bad. Other family dynamics can make us feel safe and free to be ourselves. 

Looking at this for every group of people you spend your time with, what are the reasons you enjoy each of them? Social connection, feeling smart, learning new things, being inspired etc. Too often we end up spending time with people or communities we don't really enjoy. How much are you drawn to drama, even when you find that it doesn't enrich your life? Some communities thrive on that kind of culture. Sometimes people participate in communities to avoid missing out on things that they imagine happen without them. 

The communities we choose to prioritize have a major impact on who we become. If I spend time in communities where the prevailing view is that life is harsh, difficult, and painful, I'll start to feel that way too. If I spend time in communities where people are positive and optimistic, I'll start to feel that way too. By choosing in advance and consciously asking myself what a community looks like and what it's culture is like, I can decide in advance where I spend my time and predict how that might shape me as a person. 

It can be good to get a diverse set of exposure too. I don't want to bury my head in the sand and ignore reality, nor do I want to feel hopeless or overly cynical. Communities can also be great practice at being independent and consistent: if I find myself changing drastically between different groups of people, that can be a sign that I'm doing things to fit in rather than to genuinely learn or interact with people. Once you're in the heat of the moment it can be difficult to leave a community or a situation that you know isn't good for you. Structuring your social group priorities in advance minimizes those difficult moments by setting you up for success. If you want people who'll challenge you and tell you the truth, then seek them out and spend time with them in advance. Match your expectations with what you know about the community and do expect to be changed by them. 

There is no scarcity of communities out there. Fear of losing out on our place in a community can also drive us to participate more or dampen down on our identity to conform and keep the peace. It's far better to seek out communities that fit your needs than to accept whatever you've ended up with. This is especially true when the communities you seek are also places that would love to have you, which is more often than we realize. People who keep just a few close friends are already familiar with this. Deciding what you're looking for in the communities you prioritize already sets you on the path to start spotting those opportunities. 

One last note: When people show you what they're like, believe them. Be open to taking people at their word, especially when they're indicating that their style really isn't for you. Plenty of communities are structured to either eliminate people who wouldn't fit in, or to actually pressure people into trying to fit in and work hard to be accepted. If you ever sense that this is happening, it's worth taking a deep look at what your goals are and why you're interested in that community. The clearer you make your goals, the easier it is to minimize the time spent with people who diminish them and maximize the time and energy spent with people who do push you to grow in that direction. One litmus test can just be to think of the most embarrassing or weird things about yourself to share and try sharing them. See if people try to make fun of you or ostracize you for it. That can be a great way to gauge whether you're part of a community simply because of shallow expectations, or whether it's a community or group of people where you can have your own identity and aren't expected to conform.
