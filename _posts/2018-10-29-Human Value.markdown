The beauty in empathy is that it's not about you or someone else but the collective instead. Our uniquely human ability and even obligation to synthesize and experience the feelings of others as vividly and intensely as our own is what's going to carry us into the next century. 

Our growing understanding of the billions of perspectives out there makes us less attached to our own. It's inevitable that we connect on a scale unprecedented and unimaginable (at least by me right now). Perhaps it's already happening and we just don't know it yet. We value each other intrinsically in ways we never have and I'm sure we'll discover new ways tomorrow. The Titanic filled with ideas and habits of division and hatred is rapidly approaching its demise and we are the iceberg. Every human being is along for the ride and time is all it will take. We are one and more of us realize that everyday.
