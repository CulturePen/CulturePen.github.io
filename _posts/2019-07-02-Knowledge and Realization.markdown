We have this very implicit belief that we can only realize something that we did not know already. It can get in the way of relearning concepts we think we understand because every time we realize something new, we feel like we must have been ignorant before. There are also plenty of times we gain a deeper emotional understanding of something that we've rationally and logically believed but emotionally fought for years. Sometimes realization feels rewarding and comes about from a bout of creative insight, where the process feels productive and indicative of growth, rather than making us feel like we must have been lacking before. We can affect that judgment and seek to make realization feel rewarding, even when it requires rewriting past ideas. There are plenty of possible realizations we skip over and never explore, in part because what they might mean to us is scary or discomforting. It might mean we were blind before, or that we were mean or even make us feel stupid. These reactions and responses can help us understand why we might avoid certain lines of thought and questioning. They can act as signs to show us we might be onto something. 

It's not that we can't figure things out. Sometimes it really is that we don't want to, and we can learn to figure out why that happens. The answers are different for all of us, but the questions may not be.
