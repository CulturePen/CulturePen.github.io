>*Want to know the not so well-kept secret of creating work that matters? ... Let everything in.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; AJ Leon__, [*The Life and Times of A Remarkable Misfit*](http://aj-leon.com/pursuitofeverything/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/The-Life-and-Times-of-A-Remarkable-Misfit.pdf "The Life and Times of A Remarkable Misfit - AJ Leon")

Much of life is a series of mirages, illusions we pass down as facts; not always consciously, but often without question. Well intentioned fallacies that take experience and exposure to unravel and unlearn. One of them is the illusion of relevance, the idea that we know best what matters and what doesn't. *Narrow your focus, don't waste your time, experiment only with the known, and don't make a bet you can't win*. It's great advice to pursue the things we're taught to want, but terrible advice to feel the fulfillment we need. No great breakthrough was found along a straight path, and neither is life. The next time you think of something as irrelevant, question that thought and ask why you feel that way. Ask yourself too, are you thinking for the next 5 minutes, days, years, decades, or centuries? There is no right answer here, but there are plenty of questions worth asking. 

When was the last time you experienced something simply to experience it? With no expectation of outcome and no thought of relevance, importance, or priorities. The models we build around feeling productive and efficient often leave us feeling guilty when we pursue the very human feelings of engagement and joy. The irony is that when you let everything in before judging it, you no longer feel the need to judge it after it's through your doorway. Everything is meaningful if given the chance to be. Everything circles back to making sense when you aren't trying to force things to fit in. Your very idea of the puzzle changes and the pieces you were thought couldn't fit before now fit; just as a different part of the puzzle. What you used to consider irrelevant is now central to the new puzzle and it all comes together effortlessly. It's not the pieces that were malformed, but your idea of the puzzle itself. 

The world doesn't change until you do, and when you do, you longer feel like it has to.
