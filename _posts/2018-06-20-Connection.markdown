There have only been two periods in my life where I’ve felt truly inspired. 

The first was almost exactly a year ago when I landed a job at a great company that I thought I didn’t deserve.  It was my first real, corporate career. 

The second period of inspiration began yesterday, when I quit that same job.  

It’s funny how life works sometimes, isn’t it?

I took the first period of inspiration for granted because I believed it would last forever.  This time I know it won’t.  

Not unless I make it so. 

Until today, I always thought of inspiration as something that happens to people, a force of nature that sweeps us off our feet and leaves us breathless when it passes. Today I learnt that it is summoned and nurtured by us, and that when it “just happens” to us, it’s because we called for it. 
I believe the key is connection. Genuine, spontaneous, meaningfully human connection. 

We’ve all experienced connections like these and it’s nearly indescribable with words, yet completely relatable to us all. I’ve had three such connections with complete strangers, all on public transit. All three of these connections happened when I was feeling inspired, and all three of them nurtured my inspiration further in a virtuous upward cycle. I’ve shared one of them below in an attempt to put words to what I felt then, and what I feel now.

I boarded the bus late one evening, exhausted from a long day’s work at my newfound job. I leaned back in my seat, running the day over in my mind and feeling a warm glow from the difference I felt I had made at work that day. A rugged backpacker with long tangles of blond hair sat down across from me. I distinctly remember a voice inside of me whispering, *“Talk to him, ask him about his day, say—”*

“You look tired, but satisfied.” I blurted out abruptly, my train of thought coming out as words. *Did I really just say that?* 

“Me?” He looked up at me. “Yeah. I suppose I am. I’ve had a long day, but it was very exciting.” 

A smile formed on his face, and that’s how I met Justin. 

We spoke of our days, then our lives, and then the world as a whole, (he’s an avid traveler) all the way to his stop, which turned out to be mine too. By the time we got off and started walking together, we were practically finishing each other’s sentences and I found myself nodding enthusiastically at his ideas. We ended up walking past my home, all the way to his door. We hugged each other and exchanged phone numbers with a promise to connect again in the future. 

We never did connect again, but the memory of that single connection brings the silliest grin to my face, and I can’t wait to give him a call tomorrow and exchange updates from our lives this past year. 

*Connections inspire, and inspiration connects.*

When I woke up this morning, I was going to write a potentially very dry post about core values and why they’re important. I thought that was the kind of content people would want to read. But after what I've learnt today, I know that kind of writing isn’t me.

The post you just read represents a piece of myself, and there’s nothing more satisfying to me than sharing that with the world. We all sell or give away pieces of ourselves to the world in different ways, for reasons unique to each of us. 

I realize now the importance of having meaning in the way I do that with my life. This blog is how I choose to create meaning in what I do, and so the promise I make to myself and to you is to share a genuine piece of myself this way every day, for the rest of my days. 

Thank you for accompanying me on this journey.
