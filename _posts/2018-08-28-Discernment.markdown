>*Seeing reality for what it is is what we call discernment. The work of discernment is very hard.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Lewis B. Smedes__<br>

I've been having a lot of doubts lately about the purpose of this blog and the best direction for it moving forward. After a fair bit outside advice and self-reflection, it became clear to me that avoiding writing out of a fear of lacking meaning is probably worse for the blog and myself than writing and shaping that naturally over time. In the paraphrased words of a mentor to me, some people tuck their journal away in a drawer beside their bed, while I keep mine out here. That certainly put things into perspective for me. 

I've been meaning to write about discernment for some time now, and a friend shared this very fitting talk with me, [This is Water - David Foster Wallace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI& "This is Water - David Foster Wallace"), so I figured today would be as good as any day to revive the blog. He put into words many concepts I've been struggling to even think about clearly, such as the idea that learning to think is less about the capacity to think and more about building the awareness to make what you think about a conscious choice, rather than a default setting or the path of least resistance. 

That's where discernment comes in. If anything, I think developing discernment will likely make learning more difficult than it already is, because a large of it is being willing to take the assumptions you've made over a lifetime and examine what reality might look like if you've been wrong all along. The positive to it seems to be that any conclusions you do come to might bring a sense of peace too, because you'll know what went into that understanding and feel the freedom of knowing that you'd be happy to revisit and reshape that understanding when new information comes along. 

The toughest part for me has been all the self-doubt that comes alongside the practice of developing discernment. I've been trying to figure out a way to improve the skill while not letting it erode my trust in myself or others. The key might be separating ideas and concepts from the people who espouse them, including myself. That way, having flawed beliefs or ideas doesn't necessarily make me or anyone else a flawed human being. Instead, I can learn to view those as learning moments, since we're all flawed at the end of the day. The only choice we get to make is about the ideas we choose to think about, and by extension the people we spend our time with, and how we'd like to shape our thinking over time as we grow. I was seeking out people who would challenge me, but I've learnt that I have to be more discerning about where that ideal comes from. There have been instances where people have challenged my perspective from a place of wanting to learn and teach, one of mutual growth, and those instances felt very unique. The other kind of perspective challenge that I had inadvertently been seeking out, but only now realize was unhealthy in a way, was where people challenged my perspective from a place of fear and ego. Often I didn't even realize the difference, especially since most interactions were a mix of the two, where the start was healthier than the latter half as ego got more and more involved, but it's become clearer lately that being aware of this is its own skill that can be exercised and developed. Building that awareness and discernment might just be key to growing healthily over time.
