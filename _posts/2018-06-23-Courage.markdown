>*Human beings have thrived for fifty thousand years
>not because we are driven to serve ourselves, but
because we are inspired to serve others.*       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Simon Sinek__, *Leaders Eat Last*

The greatest act of courage is vulnerability, not for ourselves, but in service of others. Hope makes us vulnerable, and each time it is crushed we close ourselves up a little tighter. We're slower to believe and quicker to suspect, until we're wrapped up in a coccoon of our own assurances. We settle for next to nothing and still find ourselves disappointed. 

Courage is fighting our way out of that coccoon and emerging stronger for it, willing to hope once more. Courage is reaching back when our greatest fears reach out to us with an old promise, *"This time will be different"*. Giving it our all once more, we risk everything for a chance at beauty. Deep down we know that even if we fail, we will fail free of guilt and regrets, ready to soar once more. 

The only real mistake is giving up before we've begun anew.
