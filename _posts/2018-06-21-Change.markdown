>*Everyone you interact with is changed forever*   
*The only questions are:*   
*How will they be different? and*   
*How different will they be?*       
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&mdash; Seth Godin</b>, *The Icarus Deception*

We often overlook our impact on the lives of others. Every word, nod, glance and shrug affects the people we surround ourselves with, the people who choose to include us in their surroundings. 

If we're going to affect them no matter what we do, why not do everything we can to make that effect an inspiring one? A genuine, positive interaction that leaves us both refreshed.

Instead we find ourselves mired in the moment, hurling words we know we'll regret in tones we know we'll apologize for. All for what? To make them understand? To prove that we're right? To win?

I used to think this was a fact of life. That we are slaves to our emotions, to the chemicals raging within us. But I'm not so sure anymore. 

Are we really? 

Has there been a single time you've caught yourself and changed your choice? Where you've travelled beyond the moment and felt the impact of a brash word or look before you've committed to it? I know I have, but I don't know what was special about those moments. 

If we can do it once, what's stopping us from doing it again? From doing it always?

I don't know. But I'd like to find out.
