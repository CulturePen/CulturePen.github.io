There's always room to do better next time, but inaction is a choice too. 

Holding back and never starting is a choice too. 

Starting and finishing badly is better than never starting, or starting and never finishing. 

I can't do better if I don't do badly first. 

This post is 6 minutes late because I spent most of today putting it off. Why is it so scary to start something that I'd then have to finish? I almost decided never to start, but that's not the promise.

The promise is to ship what I write on time, and do better the next day. Not to write perfectly, not even to write well. Just to write, and ship, and improve. 

HT Neo for encouraging me to try and fail rather than to never try at all.
