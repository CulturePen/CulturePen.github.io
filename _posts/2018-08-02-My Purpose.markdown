>*The purpose of human life is to serve, and to show compassion and the will to help others.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Albert Schweitzer__<br>
  
>*Research is formalized curiosity. It is poking and prying with a purpose.*

I've been grappling with my purpose lately and coming up against more and more questions as I progress. There are two quotes preceding today's post because my purpose lies somewhere in between these concepts. I love ideas, fostering human connection, and making a positive difference in the world and its people. The question then is, can I live a life dedicated to adding to the fulfillment of the world by using ideas to connect people with each other and themselves? Well, the obvious answer is yes, so the tougher question that follows is *how*?

I'll have to figure that out, but it feels great to settle my *why* to begin with. Now that I have a clear direction that fits the very foundation of who I am, I can build upon that foundation in a way that suits my purpose best. That will involve a binding set of core values that make difficult choices easy and keep my short-term priorities in alignment with my long-term ones. Here are a few ideas:

* **Curiosity:** Of course this tops the list, because delving deep is my very reason for existence. This has to come from a place of discovery and seeking new paradigms rather than dissatisfaction or discomfort with the current answers. The reality is the answers I might find as I delve into this are likely to make me much more uncomfortable than the status quo does.

* **People > Results:** This is a very broad value that covers many of my beliefs, such as prioritizing trust in relationships or prioritizing collaborative advantages over competitive ones. The key here is the conviction that if I place results first I will surely find them, but likely drop or neglect love and empathy at the first challenging roadblock. If I place love and empathy first, I will have no choice but to achieve my goals while building up the people around me, and I'm much more likely to be creative in the pursuit of results simply out of necessity. This value will likely change the very way I measure and plan my results too. 

* **High Expectations:** Hold myself and others to a high standard of growth and behaviour without judgment. This also includes consciously separating behaviour from personality so that I can expect more from someone who may cling to their past selves as an excuse to behave poorly in the present. After all, that someone is often myself. We are often reminded of the fact that we can live *up* to expectations, but it is all too easy to forget that we can live *down*
 to expectations too, and that we often do if aren't consciously working to set high expectations.

* **Mouldability:** Not just the ability or the willingness to change constantly, but the very desire to do so. To pursue change and growth so doggedly that I give myself no choice but to find ways to do and be differently  even when I have doubts that it's possible. Reality is always changing around us, and to not change alongside is its own form of changing backward when the world is changing forward. Some of the best change is when it seems least necessary. My other core values will guide this change in the right direction, even when no clear direction exists.
