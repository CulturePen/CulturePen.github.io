An idea a day keeps the stagnation at bay. 

I've been obsessed lately with this idea of constant change. If things don't change, then things can't improve, but I also resist many different kinds of change. Does that mean I'm OK with stagnation in those areas? Usually I'd rather improve, but I'm not thinking objectively about the change itself. I might be afraid that the change will just make things worse. The real problem is not being able to look past the short-term single instance of change vs. not change and look towards the entire system of change itself. Of course things can't improve without change, so as long as I'm prioritizing and actively instituting some changes that matter to me, I can keep making progress. 

There's this tricky pitfall to being enamoured with change though, or improvement. One mistake I've made, and continue to make, is taking in far too much information and not really applying much of it. I'm more in love with the idea of improving than I am with the process of improvement, and so I become stagnant in my desire to improve. I steep myself in books and blog posts and podcasts, but to what end? What am I really focusing on and how am I really improving myself or my life? If I can't answer that question, it's usually a good sign that all the reading I'm doing is just a way of hiding from doing something scary. Usually something uncertain, complex, or that could go wrong in many different ways and only go right in one single way. Of course, it's a self-defeating way to think about it, but learning how to change is the overarching challenge to solving that. 

Making progress on my ability to learn, change, think, and act differently and constantly, no matter how much I learn or how much time passes or how many disasters or successes strike... That's a seductive process to work towards but is it really what I want? For too long I asked what I *should* want and never really asked what I do want (and in the process I didn't figure out an answer to either of the two questions.)

Change has to happen in a direction, and we all get to influence that direction. We make choices everyday and we can change some of those choices intentionally. We can decide which stagnation is important to us to address first and we can start taking steps to improve things, even if those steps just involve the start of a single changed action that leads to breaking up and destabilizing a routine that's causing problems. Once we disrupt a bad habit or routine, it becomes much easier to disrupt again, and again, and eventually to reforge it to our wants. 

An idea a day keeps the stagnation at bay. The start of an ode paying tribute to a life-long process, for to think of stagnation as ever extinguished for good is to fall into its very jaws. It doesn't need to be two ideas a day, but it can't be zero. Progress takes consistency, but progress is also self-accelerating. An idea a day soon leads to more
