>*Going nowhere, as Leonard Cohen would later emphasize for me, isn’t about turning your back on the world; it’s about stepping away now and then so that you can see the world more clearly and love it more deeply.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Pico Iyer__, *The Art of Stillness*

An amazing, succinct read, *The Art of Stillness* encouraged me to experiment with today. I spent the morning and afternoon completely disconnected from technology and information. In the morning I shut off my phone and computer, closed any books lying around and went out to sit down on the patio. At first I was uncomfortable, restless, filled with the dreading doubt that I was simply wasting valuable time. Ironically, I couldn't even measure time passing without my phone. 

Perhaps that helped. I don't know how long I spent out there with myself, but I do know how it began to feel. Worries I didn't even know I had been harbouring surfaced and problems I didn't even know existed began to solve themselves. My resolve for the future strengthened as clarity worked its way through the fears I had hidden from myself for so long. 

It's crazy to think that there was so much I couldn't even see of myself that became clear, but I now know the value in eliminating distractions and seeking to go nowhere. It brought me peace and a deeper appreciation for the present moment. I didn't expect it to have the effect it did so I'm going to try it everyday for short periods and see how else self-reflection shapes my mind moving forward.
