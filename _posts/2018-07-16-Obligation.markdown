>*Your only obligation in any lifetime is to be true to yourself.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Richard Bach__ 

Each time I make a decision out of a sense of obligation to another, be it society, family or friends, I find myself awash with regret sooner or later. That's not to say the decision was wrong; intent matters. Choosing from a place of ego, fear, pressure, anxiety, guilt, or even anger only leads to sorrow in the long-run. Examine your emotions when you make choices and you will find that the choices most satisfying are often fueled by passion, genuine caring, empowerment and wanting to make a positive difference. 

Every instance of bowing to pressure is a disservice to ourselves, and even to those we feel obliged to. It only breeds resentment and sours the relationship over time. The people who pressure us often care deeply and want the best for us, which is why they will understand (eventually) when we need to take a path they would stay away from. Sometimes even the best of intentions cannot overcome an entrenched perspective. Only time and openness can do that. 

This is a lesson I deeply owe my mother for teaching me. Even though her words often encouraged me to play life safely and take her advice to study well, attend a good university and land a good job, her actions always supported my experiments and sometimes crazy choices. She often doubted my choices, but never doubted my essence, and eventually came to understand that I couldn't abide by a life of settling for less from myself. I wouldn't have had the confidence to make the choices I did without knowing that she genuinely believed in me, enabling me to be true to myself at a time when I felt I barely understood myself. I never did understand her wisdom or foresight until now, but it's all starting to fit into the bigger picture now. She never allowed her fears for me to turn into judgement, which she must have realized would have only damaged our relationship and isolated me deeper in my own self-doubt. Instead, she was honest with me about her worries and still chose to express her full support for me. Only now am I beginning to appreciate the approach she took and starting to realize how hard it must have been for a mother who deeply cared to suspend her fears like that. It's an attitude I choose to fully absorb and carry through in my own life. Too many times I've done the opposite, where I've allowed my perspective of a choice to cloud my belief in someone. It's about time I choose a different attitude, one of empathy and support, especially when it least makes sense.
