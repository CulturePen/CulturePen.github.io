It seems really easy to find ways to improve, to spot out aspects of ourselves we could focus on. The challenge seems to be figuring out which of it is vital and needs to be addressed first. Too often we tackle the symptoms and feel like we're progressing when we really aren't. There is some value in getting started, but somehow we have to transition that into meaningful progress rather than the self-deceptive sort. Maybe that means relying on other people who can be more objective about us than we can; maybe it means experimenting with different directions and finding ways to measure progress outside of our own opinion. 

So, how do we figure out the right balance between feeling rewarded so we keep doing the uncomfortable work of self-improvement while being picky enough to keep pushing for more vital forms of progress? It's strange, but I feel like there needs to be a way to be rewarded without losing ourselves in that space. Somehow we have to be able to look past the rewards to measure progress outside of it, so that it becomes less about reward or punishment and more about meaning. We somehow have to redefine how we perceive progress. The more it's based on an extrinsic reward, the harder it will be to pursue what's really meaningful to us.
