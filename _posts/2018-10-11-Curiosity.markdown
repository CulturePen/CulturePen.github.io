>*You can't be curious and angry at the same time.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Kat Hoch__
 
I've been working backwards lately, feeling this weird sense of peace and nonjudgment without really being able to put my finger on why or how it came to be. It's difficult to look back and point at any specific turning points or perspective-shattering epiphanies, especially since they seem to happen so regularly now. Seth Godin spoke about this idea his friend brought to his attention, that anger and curiosity cannot both control you at the same time. Curiosity has long been a core part of who I am, but I've never thought about this way. I've often wondered why I seem to remain calm, almost fascinated or intrigued in situations that seem to infuriate or provoke others. I've certainly felt anger but it so rarely lasts; most of the time it's replaced quite quickly with a sense of questioning, wonderment and thought. *Why did that make me angry?* It's only recently that I've given myself space to be curious though. For the longest time I think I was afraid to let my curiosity lead. I was taught that questions should only be asked for a practical purpose; that to question an idea is to question its maker, and to question its maker and *be wrong* is a mortal sin. So much of my identity was built around *being right* because I used to believe that was the only way I could be curious. Lately I've been much more at peace with being curious and wrong because that's really led to the insight and the realizations that I didn't even know I was so deeply craving. 

Oddly enough, this shift in my perspective has led me to what feels like genuine curiosity without judgment and without necessarily a practical or planned out agenda. It's simply curiosity for the sake of understanding. If I was reading this blog post eight months ago, I would feel guilty at this idea. I would think that something was wrong with me and that I had gone insane. But it feels like when I gave up seeking the approval and validation of others and even myself, this is what developed in its place, and now when I speak with people it feels like they sense that I'm not there to prove them wrong or right, or to judge them as good or bad, and that I'm simply there to exist and interact and learn. It's completely changed the way my interactions with others happen. The flow of meaning seems so much smoother and it's like ideas just whiz around without the barriers and boundaries of wondering how the other person is judging me or vice versa. It actually feels like every interaction with another human being has its place now and is meaningful in one way or another, even if I'll only learn why decades from now. 

It's an interesting way to live and approach interactions and I do wonder if this or some form of this will stay with me for the rest of my life. It certainly feels like it.
