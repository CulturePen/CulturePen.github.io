We often wait to be inspired before we make our move. Inspiration arrives by whim and can be beautiful when it's around, but tragic when it's not. Inspiration doesn't just cause us to start things, but also to drop them. The rarer effect of inspiration is to fuel a journey for the years it may take, especially when it grows toughest. The effects of inspiration are cultivated by some, but they don't stem from inspiration. The cultivation of those effects grows to become become self-determination, consistency, and commitment. 

Unlike inspiration, self-determination doesn't wait for the right feelings to arrive before moving. It decides that those feelings matter and works with consistency to build towards them every day. Commitment spurs action even when those feelings are still being built, or simply don't show up one day. 

We've romanticized inspiration so that we don't have to blame ourselves if inspiration doesn't strike. We wait and we watch, but in the waiting and watching we forget what we were waiting for and what we were watching for. The flashes of inspiration grow fewer and farther apart. Most of us don't even chase inspiration, we just hope that it finds and chooses us. 

It would be one thing to chase storms in a van and seek out those strikes of lightning, doggedly pursuing them with fervor. That's one way to catch inspiration. Actively seek situations and moments that inspire you and shape that journey yourself. You'll get better at it over time. It's still inconsistent and risky, but it's one way to go about it. 

It's far better than settling for in a house in a sunny, dry town. A town where rainfall is so rare it's cause for community celebration a few times a year. Choosing clear skies and dry, stable weather isn't the way to catch a lightning strike. But so many of us do this. We settle for sunny, comfortable lives while occasionally sitting on the porch and wistfully looking for a cloud in the sky, hoping that the weather will make our decisions for us. 

Better to make those decisions ourselves. We can't control the weather, but we can influence where we end up living. And ultimately we can structure lives that don't require flashes of inspiration to get moving on the projects we're both afraid and excited to make progress on.
