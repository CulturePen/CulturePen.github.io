Criminality is not what we punish.
We punish being a criminal who gets caught.
Existing as a criminal is not a crime; it is only a crime to be caught as a criminal.
Being wrong feels exactly like being right; it is only the realization that we are wrong that opens up that sinking, dreadfully devastating pit in our stomach.
We do not punish those who are wrong.
We only punish those who we catch being wrong.
We do not judge ourselves based on how wrong we are.
We judge ourselves based on how often we realize we are wrong.
Is it really a wonder then how often we are unable to admit to ourselves—let alone others—when we are wrong? 
What we perceive as a righteous existence feels far more rewarding than what we perceive as a wrongful existence. If a wrongful existence feels like a righteous one until the moment we discover otherwise, then discovery becomes the moment and possibility we fear, much like death. Discovery would kill our rewarding existence and force it to be rewritten anew... if it had its way. Luckily we have an ally. Reason steps forward as our great protector to stand steadfast in the way of Discovery, our greatest nemesis. Questions, doubts and empathy are weaponized by our nemesis—tools of its deadly, destructive trade. Beliefs, certainty and justification become our ally's sturdiest shield, protecting us from the hail of arrows our nemesis might rain down upon us. The Reaper held at bay by our valiant Archangel.
