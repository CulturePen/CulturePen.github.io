Seth Godin's concept of promises applies to much more than the relatively narrow idea I previously had of what a promise is: an explicit commitment to behave a certain way in the future, whether once or on an ongoing basis.

Much of my conception of integrity was based on promises, as well as ideas floating around like, "under-promise and over-deliver" or "don't make promises you can't keep". I ended up choosing to make less and less explicit promises and ran the wrong direction, away from commitment. What I didn't realize was that everything I did or didn't do was a promise in some form: an expectation set for myself or for others of who I was and who I was going to continue to be. 

The clothes I wear, the hair I have, and the expression I carry are all promises made. They're expectations set and either underserved, met, or exceeded. Disappointment, neutrality, and delight, respectively. Sometimes I set the bar too high and make promises I can't keep, setting myself up for disappointment. By seeing my choices and habits as promises, I can choose to promise differently. I can also start to see how my habits are ways of making promises I didn't even consciously know I was making, but which certainly became part of my identity and way of being in the world. 

Mismatched socks to encourage conversations or thick books to discourage them. Sometimes I sent mixed signals without even realizing it. Contradictory promises that gave confusing clues until someone spoke to me and received a whole different set of promises. There are the cold, brusque responses to engagement, or the warm, friendly, welcoming ones. They make a difference, but the point isn't just to make "better" promises. It's to look at the promises we're already making and see if they're promises we want to keep. If they aren't, we can replace them with other promises we prefer to make and keep. 

The way forward in any direction we want is to make promises that move us that way and keep them. I'm not a fan of "faking it till you make it" but I am a fan of making promises you'd like to keep. The flipside to this is that if keeping promises is this painful, angst-filled, teeth-clenched kinda process, it's probably not going anywhere. There's no reason to make massive promises when we can break them down into smaller, sequential, progression-based promises instead. It can start with the choice to change one aspect of your day, your routine, or your way of thinking. If the promise is difficult to think about, easy to avoid facing, and consistently falling by the way-side, then change it. But leaving things as they are when they aren't working isn't a recipe for forward motion.

Perhaps unintuitively, the most significant promises are the ones we consistently keep which take us from 0 to 1. Adding a pushup to an existing workout routine is good, but sustaining the addition of a single push-up to a routine that had 0 pushups in it or simply didn't exist as a workout routine at all... Those are the promises that open up new paths for us to build further along. Those are the promises that help us understand ourselves, whether we keep them or fail to keep them. A conscious promise is far easier to learn from than a string of unchosen promises, but we can always pay attention. The unchosen promises can shape us and we can choose to see them and their effects on us, shaping them as we wish.

The promises that are easy to keep are the ones we never needed to make; we might do those things anyway, promise made or not. But the ones that are just a little uncomfortable to keep are the ones worth making, because that's where we change. Change isn't always good, but things can't get better without change. We might as well use our promises to direct that change.
