We often consider empathy something we rely on to connect with people going through a hard time, in circumstances worse than ours or subject to misfortune we relate with. When we perceive a lack of empathy, or what we might call insensitivity, it's often in cases like this where someone isn't understanding enough towards someone going through tough times. We often fail to recognize when we lack empathy towards those we perceive more fortunate than us. In a way, any lack of empathy generally comes from the inability to see past our own perspective, or question it. When someone has everything we think we want, we have a hard time imagining why we would need to empathize with any sorrow or hardship they seem to be experiencing. The reality is fortune and misfortune are both very subjective, and empathy is about feeling things the way others are experiencing them, not the way we imagine we'd feel in the same situation. Of course, the latter is how we often synthesize empathy, but the more cognizant we become of that, the better the odds we can empathize even in situations where our first reaction might be to judge or impose our perspective first. 

This applies to many situations, and it also helps us learn to treat empathy as a way to celebrate the success and joy of others as well as share their hardships and pain. It works both ways, and the benefits to the empathizer end up being limitless.
