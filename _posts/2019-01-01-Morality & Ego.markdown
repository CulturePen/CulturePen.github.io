So much of our identity is tied to our morality. We all have different ideas of how we're good people. Being good is our way of fulfilling our identity, and in a way imposing it on the rest of the world too. A challenge arises when our morality clashes with someone else's; when we try to help someone whose idea of help differs from ours. It's hard to separate our morality from who we are, and even harder to do that for someone else. If we manage to do this though, we might just be able to understand why we feel like some people are bad, or why people we considered good turn out to be capable of bad things. 

We'd also be closer to understanding ourselves when we're surprised by our actions. Our pursuit of fitting into our identity hampers us from truly helping those around us. Helping people will involve a certain balance of respecting their morality while prioritizing their definition of success. But we have a vested interest in viewing our actions in a certain light. It's an obstacle we have to overcome somehow. Perhaps being willing to make mistakes and do bad could enable us to be better human beings.
