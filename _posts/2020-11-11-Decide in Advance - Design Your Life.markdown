It can be as simple as a "do-not-do" list or as involved as a mission statement. The point is to set clear boundaries, in writing, that keep you on a track towards your goals. Even with no written goals, we all act with goals in mind all the time, even when we feel like we're being completely spontaneous. Some of the appeal of spontaneity comes from the expectation of discarding certain boundaries or limits temporarily. That's fine, but doesn't really work when designing a system to stay on track. 

When we decide in advance what our focus is, and what we're willing to put aside for that focus, it makes future decisions much simpler. The person who has gone to bed by midnight every night for the last ten years has no trouble leaving a party early. They've had plenty of practice, and they've decided where their priorities lie. You don't have to follow the same rules anyone else does, but it's worth building your own rules. Once you know what they are, very clearly, then you can begin to change them and shape them to improve your life. You can also start saying no to a lot of things that you previously just gambled on and expected to work out by chance. If there's a certain class of activities you want to gamble on, then decide so. If you want to have coffee with people who email you at least x times a month, then decide that. Once you decide, you'll start paying attention to which offers you accept and which ones you decline. Or do you want to have coffee with absolutely everyone who asks? You can decide that too. Then do it and reshape the rules as needed, based on how things go. Once you do that, you'll start paying more attention to how these coffee meetings fit into the rest of your life. Do they enrich it or take away from it? The more specific you are, the better.

Too many of us wait for the moment when someone else asks us a question for us to know what we want. Leaving decisions off for reality and circumstances to decide for you is unnecessarily risky. Being reactive is far easier than being proactive, but being proactive is much more rewarding as you engage further in it. Your circumstances become increasingly shaped by yourself in increasingly tangible ways. 

Deciding in advance enables you to frontload as much of that thinking as possible and you get to learn from your choices more systematically rather than in isolated chunks. Deciding in advance gets you thinking in the context of other ways you could be structuring and planning and designing your life, rather than just accepting the life and routine you've ended up with. We all have room to shape various aspects of our lives, so why not use it? The worst case scenario is that you make your life worse briefly but learn something about designing your life. That's always going to pay off in the long run. 

The paralyzing anxiety of being faced with certain decisions is a topic I plan to look further into. This approach of deciding in advance and tuning those advance decisions partially addresses the angst that problem.
