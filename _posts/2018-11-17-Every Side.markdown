>*If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between "for" and "against" is the mind's worst disease.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Sent-ts'an, c. 700 C.E.__<br>

 We all live our lives trying to do a little more good than harm. How we define that, rationalize it, package it and live it out varies. My questions have been getting more nonjudgmental over time and that's started to lead me to more piercing answers that get to the root of issues. My beliefs don't feel like a noose around my neck anymore. Somehow I'm also starting to see how the beliefs of others don't have to define them either. When given the opportunity to explore other belief systems without guilt or judgment, I've found people quite open. But when I push an agenda or consider their beliefs inferior, I've found the very same people quite closed and defensive. I've noticed this shift in every one of my relationships and an outside observer might markedly say that they've changed. That may be true. 

 The binding truth to all of this that I've learnt is that people care. They deeply care about something, and if I perceive them as uncaring, it's because I haven't asked the right questions or gotten out of my own way to hear their answers. Just because they care in a different way or for a different thing, it doesn't mean that they don't care. It's so easy for us to fall into this pit. There are no sides, only people. When we understand that people are naturally drawn to forming sides, to wanting to belong, we start to notice those tendencies in ourselves too. The world needs all kinds of people, especially the kind that are nothing like me or you.
