Our identity anchors us to our reality. Make no mistake, our reality is very much something we build, and our identity keeps us tied down to it. When we question who we've always believed we are, we start to perceive a different kind of reality. I'm not sure whether it's more real but it is certainly different. When we're willing to lose our old identity, we are able to truly live in the moment without judging everything the way we used to. The habits we formed become choices to us rather than default behaviours. We become conscious of so many aspects of ourselves that we thought were traits but now find malleable. 

I wonder why that's so scary though. It's almost like dying to us. Giving up who we think we are means we have to be nothing for a while. The strange thing is we expect other people to conform to the identities we build for them too. We think they change when we glimpse them under different circumstances, but it's just us changing our perception of them. All of this to say perhaps we need to question who we are more and be more willing to step outside our identities to do things that we think don't fit who we are. We get to choose how we build ourselves everyday. It's our canvas.
