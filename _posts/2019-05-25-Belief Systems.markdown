We often think that our beliefs are within our control, that we shape them. When we dig deeper, what we find is that our beliefs are formed around necessity, not desire. We can identify exactly why we need to believe what we do, and why not believing it makes us feel a sense of loss of identity, of who we are and what we stand for. In many ways we need to lie to ourselves to feel whole, but it's a superficial sense of wholeness that never truly fulfills us. We can sense that something's missing, but when our beliefs are challenged, our first instinct is to dig in deeper and cling to what we have, afraid that questioning it might mean losing the last pieces of the things that make us who we are.  

You are more than the sum total of your beliefs, and when your identity can be decoupled from your belief systems, you become capable of exploring a myriad of beliefs without judging them, their holders, or yourself. This enables you to understand people on a much deeper and more human level than simply rationally. It also enables you to be compassionate with yourself rather than limiting yourself to certain pathways of thought and feeling bad when your mind naturally wanders and questions. 

We could all do with more humanity in our lives.
