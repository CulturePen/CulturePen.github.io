I'd rather play a game where doing well doesn't require fighting with others. Winning a positive-sum game is far more about collaboration than about competition. Even within specific industries, the positive-sum game is highly up to individual choice. Who you choose to do business with, how you interact with the ecosystem, and what values you abide by even when (seemingly) everyone else isn't all influence how positive-sum the game is *for you*. In every system there are people thriving because they creatively search for ways to create mutual value. They discover like-minded other people and groups of people because it's far more fun to collaborate with people who aren't sacrificing themselves to do good work, and who aren't expecting the game to have some losers simply to fuel the winners. Every industry is a positive-sum game; it's just that some are more obvious looking than others. The entire field of business development is specifically about finding these positive-sum opportunities and executing on them where others haven't. 

Many fields that seem inherently competitive aren't fully zero-sum games either. The most valuable and engaging competition comes from competing to explore the unknown, not competing to split up and squabble over known and existing market share. The low hanging fruit is about the easily predictable and prescribed ways to build things. Exploring the unknown is far more scarce, but entirely possible and interesting to do. Pioneering is inherently positive-sum: exploring new ground doesn't require taking existing market share from people, because it creates new market share. It's a process that's far better done in collaboration with others than in isolation alone. positive-sum games are there for anyone who looks for them and seeks ways to play them. The only way to end up playing a zero-sum game for long is to accept permanently that positive-sum games can't be created or found in any particular niche or field. 

The meta-game at play here is that we have a choice. We participate in zero-sum games partly because we can't imagine how they could be played as positive-sum games, and partly because we think that victories over losers are more enjoyable than victories alongside other winners. The possible space of positive-sum games is underexplored. People are applying increasingly better creativity to seeking win-wins rather than win-lose outcomes. More industries, like the growing content creation industries, are becoming more cooperative and collaborative rather than being competitive and combative. People openly share information and look for mutually beneficial partnerships because the entire ecosystem benefits from them. People create value by connecting others and finding and enabling win-win collaborations. On a micro scale, even within individual relationships, I think there's room for positive-sum games to create better outcomes for individuals than playing zero-sum games. 

People often think of negotiations, like salary negotiations, as inherently zero-sum interactions. If the potential hire asks for more money, the company will lose out if they say yes, and if the potential hire doesn't ask for more money, the potential hire will lose out. It turns out that some of the best negotiators are high in concern for themselves AND high in concern for others. The two traits are independent of each other: they don't conflict. The positive-sum negotiator doesn't want a deal where their negotiating partner is sacrificing. They'll do work to close a deal that's mutually beneficial and a no-brainer for both sides because that's what makes up a good long-term outcome for everyone involved. One of the biggest benefits positive-sum negotiators reap is that they become better at looking for and creating mutually beneficial deals. They become more confident at rejecting and refusing to settle for zero-sum deals where one party sacrifices. This specific raising of their standard of outcome benefits them across their lifetime, no matter what they do, and it benefits everyone they come into contact with.
