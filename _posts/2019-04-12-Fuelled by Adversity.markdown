One of the greatest disservices we do ourselves is avoiding adversity. The strangest part is that we often revel in adversity when the moment comes, but dread it beforehand. We never seem to learn from our experience that the worst is never as bad as we think and that hardship is more fulfilling than we anticipate. The growth we experience generally makes us look back on trying times with a fondness we rarely apply to future trials. We connect the dots of the past to see how everything happened exactly as it needed to, but continue to worry that a future following the same pattern will be too uncomfortable for us. 

We are best equipped to handle suffering when we look forward to it, knowing that the experience will be valuable and contribute to our progress. This is hard to do but well worth the effort. Practicing this mindset also helps us handle our negative emotions better, even in times of plenty. Quite ironically we become better at thriving when we are more prepared to suffer. More and more lately it feels like comfort has been placed at the forefront of our culture; so much so that we've stopped being aware of the downsides of such a focus. Our growth is hindered and we mature much more slowly when we prioritize comfort over growth and learning. It really is the perfect time to learn to find peace in discomfort.
