Don't get me wrong, time is certainly involved, but it's just a baseline necessity. Two people can spend the same amount of time doing the same things and come out with very different experience levels. What is it that makes that difference? I think it's a choice, one that's made repeatedly over the course of engaging with a set of tasks. The choice of curiosity in the face of uncertainty. How quickly someone gains experience has to do with how much they invest into their learning. 

One way of brute forcing forward is to spend more time but that only works up to a certain point. The bulk of progress comes from investing that time well and leaning into the scarier, more difficult aspects of the tasks. Lots of tasks end up being places to hide, like checking emails or participating in sprawling, poorly managed meetings. 

Ihe difficult part about turning down the bulk of those tasks isn't that we're disappointing others in the process, but really that it puts us on the hook to do meaningful work with that time instead. To face difficult decisions and make them, accepting responsibility for the outcomes and moving on to make more decisions immediately afterwards. That kind of forward momentum driven by curiosity is priceless and it doesn't come from time alone. It comes from a choice to face the hardest parts of the work first, even if nobody else is asking for that explicitly.
