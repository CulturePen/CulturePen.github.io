What makes a cake so delicious is how well the ingredients bake and work together. They complement each other and meld together into a sum far greater than any of the parts. The same is true for any collaborative work of art. A team of actors works on a movie together knowing that if all each person cared about was aspiring to individual greatness, they wouldn't be able to go anywhere together. If any single ingredient in a cake began to overpower the others, to want to be seen or tasted more than its perfect ratio, the cake wouldn't work. The irony is that the best path to collective inspiration is to begin by seeking personal inspiration. This is something of which we are not nearly as understanding as we could be. When the people on this path pass by us asking for directions, far too many times we nod and say, "Keep going." Sometimes what they need most is someone to say, "Stop for a moment; rest awhile and tell me where you're headed. You might find yourself surprised at what you say."

There is no 'I' in 'Team' because none of us is ever as smart as all of us. When we begin to step on others because we're too busy looking up at the peak, it becomes far too easy to stumble and slip back down. But when we look around us and know that the peak is a collective goal, not a personal one, great peaks stand to be conquered.
