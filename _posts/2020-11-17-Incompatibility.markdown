Certain choices I make will trend me towards being incompatible with other aspects of life I may want more access to or consider valuable. Focusing on learning to swim might (temporarily) exclude the time or energy I might otherwise spend on learning to run. None of these exclusions are permanent or fundamental, (unless they break the laws of physics), but there are tradeoffs involved in every choice I make. There are creative ways to solve those tradeoffs or minimize them, but they require effort to create and execute, or research, discover, learn, and implement. This post is closely related to the concept that choosing what I'm willing to give up can help me focus on what I really want. 

The incompatibilities we're choosing to trend towards are worth being honest about with ourselves. Life is made up of managing the resources that we have, however we want to think about them: time, energy, money, fulfillment etc. We can invest any of them into creating more of them too, like sleeping 8 hours a night can help with energy at the cost of time or initial energy costs to plan and execute the routine. Learning things is an example of investing resources too. Learning broad skills that are useful across a lifetime can be more of an investment than learning about specific fads that may not be around in a few months or years. Alternatively, learning very specialized, niche skills that are very interesting to an individual can offer that individual much fulfillment and other positives down the road. There's no one-size-fits-all answer for everyone. There are just tradeoffs that are worth understanding and accounting for in our decisions. 

Many of us try to structure our lives to be compatible with as many things as possible. We pull from as many sources as possible about what makes a good life and we try to build towards all of them at once. Whether it's what we see on social media, or the books we read, the movies we watch, the friends we have... they all give us a collective bubble that we use to understand the world through. Going travelling and gaining insights about other cultures is one socially sanctioned way for people to get a broader perspective, and the internet enables us to do that much more easily now as well. In the midst of all this it can be difficult to figure out what we really want for ourselves. If we're making choices that primarily build us towards lives of prestige and social status, that's fine, but not often easy to admit or realize. What do lives optimized for prestige and social status grow incompatible with? There are many ways to structure lives, but I imagine lives structured that way might reduce other benefits such as a connection to controversial ideas, reading banned books, fighting the status quo etc. There are ways to structure lives that are compatible with both, but they're relatively rare.  

Personally, I find prioritizing difficult and unpleasant. I hate looking at a list of 20 things I want to learn and taking the time to just pick the top 3 or top 1 and start learning it. (I don't even have this list of 20 things made. That should actually be my first step.) I no longer expect my life to be compatible with many aspects of life that are often considered normal or expected. I expect to be weird in ways I don't anticipate yet, simply because I haven't been paying attention to trends or tradition as much as I used to. But if I'm going to be incompatible with many of these desires, then what am I choosing to be compatible with instead? What are my priorities or goals? If I don't have a clear answer to that question written down, I will trend towards unspoken and unclear priorities. They might even end up being the priorities that I feel cultural pressure to focus on, like fashion, social skills, learning to be agreeable, or following current events more. If instead my written down priorities are to focus on more long-term and general knowledge, like learning to read, write, research, learn and think better, then I might end up with a more challenging list of priorities to follow. I'll have to hold myself accountable when I see that I'm clearly spending time and energy on priorities that just aren't on my list. Then I'd have to decide if I want to add them to my list or just spend less time and energy focused on them. 

I've shied away from further learning in the past in various subjects (like politics, philosophy, or psychology) as that learning approached this sense that I was growing more and more incompatible with people. It was a vague kind of unspoken fear, and likely not even true considering how broad and diversely minded people really are. What's likely is I had some narrow image of people based on the ones I knew in person and the ones I had interacted with in various communities online, and I figured that I was growing apart from them by what I was learning. The fear of being alienated became a real, legitimate barrier to building a meaningful identity. It's one that's worth solving if I want to be an independent thinker and doer. 

Ultimately, being incompatible with certain common situations and ideas might not be a bad thing. It might actually just be a sign that I'm at least on a unique path, if not necessarily a safe and stable one. Especially as I become increasingly compatible with some ideas and situations that do not have social sanction, I may have to continually re-acclimate myself with this idea of being okay with incompatibility. Trying to match social consensus closely and be compatible with it can be very draining and has its own opportunity costs. It's the right choice in some situations but I think I've unconsciously lived my life too far on that side of things without realizing it. It doesn't strike me as a worthwhile goal or way to live, even though I seem to continue to live that way in some situations, like when I'm speaking with someone in person. 

It'll take time and effort, but I think one of the best investments I can make right now is learning to make my choices while being conscious of the incompatibilities I'm accepting alongside them. If I dig deeply enough into anything, I will very likely end up with ideas that are not common, and potentially even very divisive or socially dangerous to explore.
