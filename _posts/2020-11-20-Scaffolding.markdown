I've come across this term a few times recently while learning about business and game design. It's meant slightly different things each time I've come across it, but the general idea seems to be that planning projects out with an end in sight gives each project a thread of continuity. Each project contributes to the skills and learning necessary to make the next project more effective. 

In another sense, more related the construction industry, scaffolding could also mean putting structures in place that support ambitious projects. Trying to build something without the right support structures in place could just mean it falls apart. What would scaffolding look like in personal development? Maybe it means approaching personal development projects in an intentional, structured way too. If I can see the way a certain skill builds towards mastery in another skill, and I care about both, then it would makes sense to start with the skill that builds the scaffolding necessary for the next skill. This applies even to learning things by breaking them up into different skills and learning those skills independently. Like if my goal is to exercise every day, then even learning to do something I enjoy every day on a specific schedule, as the building blocks for a routine, could build towards the scaffolding needed to implement and carry out an exercise routine. Part 1: Learn to stick to a routine on something. Part 2: Learn to apply that routine to something like exercise. Sometimes it's fine to approach both at once and just do both together, since there might be enough existing scaffolding to get it working right away. Breaking skills down is helpful when trying to do everything at once to implement a new skill isn't working well.   

Looking to create some kind of specific continuity between a plan's elements also helps clarify the intention behind each element. Sometimes elements are in there just because they're so common and normal, rather than because they fit a specific purpose or plan. Looking at a plan or a project from the perspective of, "What future plans does this one enable? What kind of scaffolding is this project building, and what kind of scaffolding does it need?" assists me in rooting out superfluous elements that were camouflaged before I asked those questions.
