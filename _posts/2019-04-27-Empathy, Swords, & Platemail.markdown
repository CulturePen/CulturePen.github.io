I just had another discussion with my friend where he asked for my perspective on a letter he was writing to his friend explaining some of his actions. Essentially he had a falling out with a girl in the group (We'll call her B) who he had liked romantically, and he's been feeling unfairly judged by the other friends in the group for his behaviour. Our conversation about this ended up lasting over three hours but some great insights had come up by the end. My friend, L, read me the letter he had drafted to his friend Z, outlining the circumstances he had been in and how he felt the actions he took ended up being bad, but that his intentions were good and at the time he felt he had no other way to move the situation forward. L had been having regular disagreements with Z's perspective and felt that Z wasn't being objective and was unfairly supporting B and believing only her side of the story. After hearing his letter, I realized how skewed his perspective was in supporting his own innocence, and I attempted to point this out to him. It was clear to me that he was justifying and rationalizing his behaviour based on his intentions, without really empathizing with how B or Z felt based on what they had been through and observed. 

We went back and forth for three hours with little progress until the pivotal point in our conversation where things began to line up for both of us and mutual understanding began to emerge. I've paraphrased the end of the conversation below to show how it went:

**L:** It feels like they've judged me and aren't willing to change their mind no matter what I say. I just want them to understand how I felt. 

**Me:** That's a perfectly reasonable desire. However, if I were to ask them right now whether they feel that you understand their perspective and how they feel, is there a single person in the group who would say yes?

*Silence for a moment, then a tentative response.*

**L:** Probably not...

**Me:** How can you expect them to listen to you and want to understand you if they don't feel like you're willing to do the same for them?

**L:** I don't see how that's necessary for them to understand me!

**Me:** Look, I get that you feel like this is unjust and that they're treating you unfairly. *He nods.* But those feelings are not helping you right now. If you go in feeling like you deserve to be heard, but don't offer them the same courtesy, then of course they'll never want to hear you out. They'll sense your entitlement and you'll come across as feeling justified in what you did, even if you believe it was wrong. It's like you're approaching Z in full platemail with your sword and shield raised high and asking him to hear you out unarmed. Of course he's going to bring the biggest battleaxe he can find when he comes to face you! The reason you've constantly been butting heads over this is because you're approaching him expecting something you aren't willing to offer yourself. 

**L:** What do I do then?

**Me:** Well, let me ask you this first. Step out of your shoes for a moment and imagine that you were B's boyfriend. Yes, I know Z isn't her boyfriend, but just imagine that you are. Now a guy in the group, let's say it's a carbon copy of you, L, ends up harassing her and makes her feel trapped and unsafe. She blocks him and cuts off all contact, and he gets in touch with you to explain his side of the story. You hear him out as he explains that he really cares about her, had the best of intentions, and just lost control in the moment. He wants you to understand that he's pure of heart and would never want to hurt her, and hopes that you can forgive him and he can make up for it from now on. How would you feel? How would you respond? 

**L:** Well it seems like he's just making excuses!

**Me:** That's exactly how you come across to Z and everyone else in your friend group.

*Quietly*, **L:** Oh.

*After a few seconds of silence.*

**Me:** That's what empathy is. Even though you know how good your intentions seem to yourself, you now understand exactly how they come across to others, and how they would come across to you if you were on the other side. 

**L:** But how is that possible? How can I be so sure that I'm good and right, but also be so sure that if it was someone else, I would respond the same way Z has been responding to me?

**Me:** I don't know... Well, I'd say it's likely your ego. You're attached to your sense of self and who you are. To you, you will always be good, nice, well-intentioned L who would never hurt another person intentionally. As long as you hold onto that image of yourself, you will never be able to see your actions the way they are to everyone else. You'll always have a tinted perspective. 

*He digests this for a moment before I continue, using this understanding to segue into the key point.*

**Me:** Now, imagine if you have a different kind of conversation with Z. Instead of sending him this letter you wrote which you can now see is filled with excuses, at least from his perspective, what if you were to say something like: *Hi Z. I've reflected a bit and had a conversation with a trusted friend who helped me gain some perspective. I put myself in your shoes and realized that the way you're treating me is exactly how I would treat you if our roles were swapped. Your protectiveness of B is completely justified based on my behaviour and I can no longer blame you for it. I completely understand how you feel and take full responsibility for my actions as well as accept your judgment of me*

*He replies softly, murmuring to himself pensively*

**L:** Huh... he's actually doing a really good job... from that perspective. 

Me: Exactly. Imagine if you approached him genuinely believing that the way he felt was justified and that he was actually doing a good job. How would we react? You're putting aside your armor, your shield, and your sword, and you're approaching him with complete openness and vulnerability to say that you understand, and you mean it. Do you really think he's going to take a swing at you with his axe? 

...

**L:** Probably not.

**Me:** You've been raised to believe that your armour and your shield are necessary tools in this world, but in many cases like this one, they're actually holding you back from meaningfully progressing with friends like Z. When you're vulnerable, the dynamic changes entirely for the other person too, no matter how angry they might have been. In fact when you do this, it's likely that *he* will then approach *you* to ask for *your* side of the story, to understand your circumstances better. He'll think to himself, *What made L understand me this way so suddenly? Is it possible that I misunderstood what he went through? I need to understand him better,* and he'll actually *want* to hear your side of the story, rather than you feeling like you need to force him to listen to you. 

*He begins to nod with some enthusiasm.*

**Me:** That's the beautiful irony here. When you decide that understanding him is more important to you than being understood by him, he will want to reciprocate and will feel like seeking to understand you too. You get what you wanted by putting aside that desire long enough to genuinely empathize with him. 

**L:** That's so crazy man.

**Me:** I know... It's unintuitive but when we lay it out like this it just makes perfect sense. Your approach hasn't been working, and it's not because your sword wasn't sharp enough or your shield lacking in sturdiness. You just had to consider putting the weapons away and empathizing with your opponent... who really isn't your opponent anymore.

That conversation taught me so much and formalized a bunch of random thoughts that were just bouncing around in my head. It made me realize that so many interpersonal conflicts could be solved by putting away our weapons, but it's the last thing we're taught to do when it's really the only realistic, effective response. Everything else is just... destructive, even if it ends up working. There's unnecessary collateral damage, whereas conflict solved this way grows relationships instead of damaging them. 

Also funnily enough this reminds me of a random quote from Ender's Game which went something like, *"In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves."* 

We all deserve to learn to love this way, and it's more possible than we realize. I'm going to figure out if there's a way to make this stuff more enjoyable to apply and reduce the strain it puts on our egos and senses of self-worth. There's got to be a way to transition out of our current mindsets into ones that better fit the future we envision for ourselves. It's a problem worth working on.
