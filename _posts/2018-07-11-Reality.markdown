>*"Why shouldn't truth be stranger than fiction? Fiction, after all, has to make sense."* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Mark Twain__

As I was exposed to more of what I never knew, I learnt that if I'm to go on this quest in search of everything beneath the surface, I would have to be prepared to be surprised over and over again. I would have to expect things not to fit together logically for a time, not until I come across enough pieces for the puzzle to start to come together and make sense.

Every piece of fiction written has come from some brain's imagination, from a human being who has experienced life a certain way and built their reality around their memories. But the truth is not always going to fit our reality. We have to be willing to constantly mould our reality to reflect change, regardless of how it affects our ego or our need to be right. If there's the slightest doubt niggling at you that you might be wrong, then take a moment to assume that you are and envision what your reality looks like now, from this new perspective. You might find it invigorating. 

Set out to prove yourself right, and you will find yourself being told exactly what you want to hear. Set out to prove yourself wrong however, and you will find truth.
