Had an interesting discussion with my dad, who's around 60 years old now. He explained how things are getting so complicated today when they were so much simpler in the past. I resisted some of what he was saying, but I also found parts of it fascinating to think about. The largest sticking point was about evolving technology and the expectations that go along with it. To be a manager at a retail store today, the expectation is that you have to have a cell phone and an email address. That alone isn't the problem: the problem is the expectations that go along with that access. The sort of unspoken but subtle boundary pushing of being expected to be available by phone anytime they need you. 

Mutual trust is damaged by managers or workplace cultures that do this. When boundaries like that are pushed on and changed, social expectations shift. The answer isn't to be less connected of course, but to enable that connection to be in control of the people being connected. Similar to co-op house designs, where organic encounters with other residents are designed alongside privacy and individual spaces. The resident gets the choice to have both community and isolation, rather than being shoehorned into just one or the other. My dad's impulse to disconnect is understandable because it takes effort to live in a connected world and structure life to withstand the pressure and norms that blur those boundaries. Expectations shift over time and we have to find ways to enable people to opt out just as easily as they can opt in. It's an ongoing challenge as we innovate and integrate the internet and connection into more and more of our lives. Trust is also damaged when individuals request not to conform to expectations that don't work for them. 

The meta-expectation that helps with all of this is direct, explicit expectations. My dad doesn't necessarily expect not to be bothered outside of work. What he really dislikes is that it's an accepted norm with no explicitness. He can't defy it or dissent because to do so would be considered unreasonable or rude. This is what legal contracts attempt to do: make specific expectations clear and explored rather than leaving them unclear and unexplored. Companies benefit from clearly outlined expectations too. No company benefits from damaged trust, and employees are usually happy to be called on for genuine, time-sensitive emergencies. But when that trust is abused with manufactured urgency or an entitlement to an employee's response quickly on the weekend, it's no surprise that it can generate animosity between the two parties.  

How do we react when our expectations aren't met? Can we innovate on the way we adapt to situations when our expectations aren't met, even when those expectations seem obvious or completely normal? Expectations that become normal and widespread aren't always going to be reasonable to many individuals. I think one of the improvements we're making widely is that more and more individual preferences can be met with minimal sacrifice from others or the world at large. Companies don't have to sacrifice to build relationships with their employees that are mutually beneficial, but there's lots of room for us to design and nurture them better.
