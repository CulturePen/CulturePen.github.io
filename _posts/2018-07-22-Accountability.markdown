>*When we fail to set boundaries and hold people accountable, we feel used and mistreated. This is why we sometimes attack who they are, which is far more hurtful than addressing a behavior or a choice.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Bren√© Brown__

We get what we expect. Especially from ourselves. The least we can do is hold our behaviour to a higher standard, or we'll never find it improving. The same applies to how we treat others. Of course, we get defensive with ourselves and others when we're held accountable, but only because we allow our behaviour to define us. We personalize our mistakes and beat ourselves up, but all that does is hinder progress. The key is to believe in our (and other's) best selves, not our worst, and treat behaviour as mouldable. 

Accountability isn't about attacking someone. On the contrary, it's about respecting who they are to the point of not letting poor behaviour slide. Accountability applies to yourself and others, and when you approach someone with respect for them but not their behaviour, they will sense that. But if you allow someone's behaviour to cloud your belief in them, to turn into judgement and contempt, then they will sense that too. The next time you hold someone accountable and find them putting up walls, take a look at yourself and make sure it isn't because you're holding a hammer. Approach from a place of understanding their intent and you just might find excuses and accusations replaced by appreciation and open communication. 

The worst thing we can do for ourselves or others is to stay silent when a wrong is committed. The second worst is to attribute that wrong to its doer's internal essence. Change these two factors and everything else will change alongside them, including your perspective on yourself and others.
