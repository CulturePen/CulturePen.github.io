I came across some interesting ideas from Jordan Peterson recently. One of them was about speaking with precision; this is part of a goal I've been pursuing of learning to be more honest and congruent. JP also had some thoughts on congruency; basically the idea that the more congruent a person is, the more their words and actions match their feelings and thoughts in any given situation. Many of us go through life feeling constrained in our choices, always holding back or biting our lip when things get uncomfortable. I need to learn to voice my discomfort and address issues with the people around me instead of letting them fester. Choosing my words thoughtfully is an important part of that. By thinking through what I want to say a few times and comparing it to how I really feel, I can communicate more honestly and precisely, and ultimately lower misunderstandings. 

The opposite of speaking precisely would be speaking vaguely. This is an easy way to hide the truth and even deceive myself. The more wiggle room I give myself in my words, the easier it is for me to make an excuse or justify myself later. It moves me away from accountability, which is ultimately the only way I can learn and grow from my mistakes or failings. 

Speaking precisely also means avoiding giving impressions that are untrue or misleading. Something else JP said was "Don't agree to what you don't agree to", which might sound obvious but is a principle we've all failed at some point. No disagreement is too small to address, because the alternative just leads to resentment. That doesn't mean people have to hash everything out right away, but it does mean refusing to give the impression that a matter is resolved until it truly is resolved to your complete satisfaction. It's also on you to hold the other person accountable to this; don't take a half-hearted concession. Instead, try to understand why it's half-hearted, and if they're just tired of the discussion, bench it for another time. Just make it clear that it's not resolved and that you're still willing to hear them out at any point and change your mind if you're missing something or simply wrong. 

Silence can be just as imprecise as any speech.
