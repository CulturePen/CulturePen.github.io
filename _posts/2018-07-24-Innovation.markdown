>*Yet despite all the research and literature, I still observe executives exhibiting the same lack of courage or knowledge that undercut previous waves of innovation. They declare that they want more innovation but then ask, "Who else is doing it?" They claim to seek new ideas but shoot down every one brought to them.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Rosabeth Moss Kanter__ *Innovation: The Classic Traps*

It seems particularly difficult to innovate when things are going well and we're comfortable. However, that feeling of comfort can trap us into a false sense of security. Often the best innovations and adaptations are the ones that anticipate and lead change rather than simply react to it. Besides, I find it very fulfilling to constantly be growing, and innovation is key to growth and combatting stagnation. 

It's natural even within innovation to seek the comfort in the question, "Who else is doing it?", but to truly grow we have to see past what's been done and look toward creating something for the first time. Innovations don't have to be mind-shattering new developments, they can simply be a different approach or fresh perspective to something we already do, whether we do it poorly or poorly at present.

Kodak is an oft-quoted example of failing to innovate in a changing market, losing their dominance of the market when it shifted from film to digital photography. They weren't blind though. The first digital camera was invented by a Kodak engineer, Steve Sasson, and they held the first patent on the technology. This is one of the cases Gary Klein studies in his quest to understand insight, and it's fascinating to view the story from this perspective. Kodak started the digital revolution, but was reluctant to give up the high profits they gained from film for the smaller profits from digital cameras. In other words, their greed in the short-term blinded them to the losses they would face if they didn't change before they were forced too.

Looking back, we see this pattern repeated time and time again of organizations having all the data but making decisiosn from a place of remaining comfortable, rather than pushing the boundaries. That is why I believe the key is a mindset that finds innovation fulfilling, rather than one that pursues it out of necessity. Because by the time innovating conventionally is necessary, we are already off to a late start fuelled by hindsight rather than foresight.
