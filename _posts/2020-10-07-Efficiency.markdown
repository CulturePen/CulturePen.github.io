I spent most of yesterday setting a routine and practicing sticking to it. I recorded the time I spent on everything and one thing I noticed is that I felt hurried during certain periods. The process kept me focused and I quickly became aware of distractions, but I also felt stressed during most parts of the day. I managed my attention better as the day went on, but it got me thinking about how trying to get more done in less time doesn't scale nearly as well as focusing on the right things to begin with.

Rather than trying to get 8 hours of work done (with much of it spent distracted or frazzled), what if I could find a way to spend 3-4 hours of time well-focused and engaged in something meaningful? Then I could spend a few hours on email, research, and other less concrete tasks. The other thing I noticed is that when I slowed down and let myself get distracted a few times, I'd sometimes have creative insights and solve problems in unexpected ways. It's still a work in progress but I think there's a way to stay focused on a goal and mindful of how I'm allocating my attention without feeling stressed or harried. 

Being preoccupied throughout most of the day because I felt like I had to be productive for all of it probably led to missed opportunities to engage with some meaningful moments. Many of these weren't amenable to being recorded on a time-tracking spreadsheet and I pressured myself to get them done with as quickly as possible. I'm not sure what the tradeoffs were in a day spent that way but it'll be interesting to make some more changes and test how it feels over time. 

Most of the opportunities to speak up or do something scary but meaningful aren't primarily about spending time. A five minute conversation that I never start could have more value in my day than an entire afternoon spent working. It's challenging to view them as opportunities until after I've let them pass by me. Figuring out how to make choices and take action when I would otherwise stand by and wait is going to be more valuable than spending my time more efficiently, but observing myself sticking to this routine might be a way to surface some of those fears and start to acknowledge them rather than avoid them.
