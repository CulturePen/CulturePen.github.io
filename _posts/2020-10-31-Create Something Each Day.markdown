Make a conscious choice to create something each day. Place that first piece down and contribute more pieces. They'll fit together even if you don't see how yet. A body of work that only takes shape as the pieces are formed. No two puzzle pieces will be the same, and neither will any of the wholes they begin to form. You can even create an intangible connection with another person, but make it an intentional choice. Choose to create something that didn't exist before, and wouldn't have existed if you hadn't made that choice. Start to check where these pieces are going and see if you like the direction. Don't look at what other people say, but decide for yourself. Choose to divert that path consciously. 

A commitment to creating something each day is also a commitment to looking, noticing, and taking action. It's all connected.
