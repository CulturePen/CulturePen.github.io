What are the thoughts I'm afraid to think? I know they're there, somewhere. I've felt them, sensed them, even thought them sometimes. 

Hiding from myself doesn't me out of ruts, only further into them. The continual drive to uncensor my thinking is an ongoing process but I don't know what progress looks like. Sometimes I say things out loud before I can think them and those are curious moments to observe. They're also frightening and tense. 

It's not the thoughts that scare me so much as the censorship. Who exactly is censoring me? Why am I afraid to notice I'm afraid? 

Some of the fears seem to come from a worry of changing and not belonging, even though I partly know those worries rarely ever materialize. The habit of worrying itself seems to be self-accelerating. Replacing it with something better is part of the challenge, but this censorship and opacity and vagueness of my own experience of my mind is getting tiresome. Taking some of what I'm going through and finding a way to make it useful to others might be part of the way forward, but I have no idea what this is like for other people. Everyone's so different in so many ways, and also so alike in others. 

Ultimately as I get better at capturing some of these experiences and drawing a thread between them over time, I'll start to get a better perspective of the present as it relates to the past.
