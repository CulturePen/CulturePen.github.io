>*Lessons are all around us, waiting to be learned.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Daigo Umehara__, *The Will to Keep Winning*<br>

I met someone at the recent Dota 2 event at Rogers Arena and we ended up chatting indepth over the next few days. Half the concepts either of us brought up seemed to already be familiar to both of us, which made the other half all the more valuable. The more we seemed to progress in our conversation, the broader our shared pool of meaning grew. 

We would often set out to explore a specific concept only to find ourselves discussing something completely different mere minutes later. We talked about that pattern as it occurred repeatedly and came to a few theories before we were inevitably distracted by another concept. 

I wrote this post, [Experience](http://culturepen.com/blog/post/2018/07/28/Experience.html "Culture Pen - Experience"), last month exploring the four factors Gary Klein had found separate the discovery of insights between people in the same situation with access to the same information. One of them, which he considers a trait more than a skill, is the tendency to reason playfully rather than concretely. This involves not just the willingness to but the very enjoyment of juggling hypotheticals and rushing off on tangents with little regard for what's immediately being considered vital to the conversation. I think of it as curiosity on steroids.

We both seemed to be playful reasoners and so we simply couldn't stay on a single subject for long. I began to see it as the collaborative weaving of a web, strand by strand, but in many directions at once with an ever expanding range of growth. We would set out to weave the web a certain way by exploring an idea or topic together to build a better understanding of it through our differing perspectives, but instead find the web growing in a completely different direction. The very expectations and ideas of where we wanted to find ourselves on the web also shifted alongside it, often ending up anywhere along its strands as it spread outward. The more we resigned ourselves to the experience and suspended our expectations, the more the web seemed to lead us exactly where we needed to be, if not where we wanted to be. 

It felt like the first time I was consciously aware of the weaving of this web from the beginning and able to perceive how it progressed. It's likely a process that's unique to every possible combination of individuals. I look forward to exploring the process more and understanding how it differs from combination to combination based on their perspectives and approach.
