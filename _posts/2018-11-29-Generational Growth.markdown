I came across this askReddit thread titled, [*Teachers of Reddit, what are some positive trends you have noticed in today's youth?*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a0vt8e/teachers_of_reddit_what_are_some_positive_trends/ "askReddit Thread") the other day and it got me thinking. A common thread running between answers seemed to be that kids today are less afraid to be nice to each other. Differences are treasured and protected rather than persecuted. Things we used to consider "just kids being kids" are no longer so often perpetrated by kids today. A father told the story of how he had warned his mildly autistic son that school might be difficult, that other kids would tease him in middle school and that high school would be even harder on him. "15 years ago I would have been right. Fast forward to now, and I'm constantly amazed and grateful for how well he is treated. Even the 'jock' kids and big snotty idiot kids who would make perfect bullies are inclusive, kind and even sometimes *protective* of my son." 

Empathy seems much more commonplace and valued, with caring for people potentially being appreciated above caring for grades. Kids are much more self-reflective in today's world, with more emotional maturity in general. They're more understanding and clear with their expectations of others, while being less judgmental and imposing of their own perspectives. In other words, they display many of the traits we often think of when we describe someone as wise. 

I wonder what else we'll start to see as they grow up. They will define the world we live in after all.
