There's no such thing. There's only Life, with a capital L. Yet our culture is so obsessed with the concept of managing a work-life balance, while we view every other choice of time spent as a part of our life. In a way this stems from the prevalence of the 40 hour work week and the implication that we don't really get to choose how we spend our work time. It's all spent working, and our "free time" is what we get to manage. If we want to tip the scales further towards life, then we need to reduce our work hours, and vice versa if we want to tip the scales further towards work. I would argue that some of the most fulfilled people have managed to integrate their work into their lives the same way we all integrate sleep, spending time with friends, our hobbies, and eating and grooming into our lives without a second thought. Part of this involves looking at the quality of time spent alongside the quantity. Work doesn't just have to be about selling hours of our time for money; finding ways to make it engaging and enjoyable can be far more fulfilling for us than working half as much. If you find that your life revolves around your weekends, then it's likely something worth addressing. How can the quality of your work time match up to the quality of your life time?
