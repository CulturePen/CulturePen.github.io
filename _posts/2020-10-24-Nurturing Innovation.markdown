What kinds of poetry haven't been invented yet? 

It's hard to imagine what doesn't exist yet. Even harder is then building that thing and working to make it exist to the point where it's self-sustaining and larger than any individual or specific, fixed group of people. Most creations aren't going to be this way, but some exist and pass themselves on for generations. 

I grew up with the internet and the only way I can imagine what it was like before the internet is by reading about it from people who lived that out. The amount of collective effort that must have gone into the development and spread of the internet must have been massive. The amount of effort that didn't culminate directly in results must have been even larger. The internet has also changed significantly over the course of the last decade, with detailed, niche blog posts existing on nearly any topic of interest. Part of the reason for this is that the more people are on the internet, the more individuals can build a niche audience and sustain themselves through their content online. The internet is self-accelerating in nature because it's better for everyone involved to have the option to be connected.

It's difficult for me to imagine a post-internet world without something fulfilling a similar function to the internet ([or three internets](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/internet-google-china-balkanization.html "Opinion: There May Soon Be Three Internets. America's Won't Necessarily Be The Best")). But that too is a possible future. The internet is young relative to some fairytales and fables, but it's been collaborated on significantly more across the globe. The internet of today is significantly broader than the internet of 10 years ago, both in terms of the content that exists but also in terms of the number of people connected. I don't know if it's fundamentally different today than it was 10 years ago, but I wonder what changes its undergone that aren't widespread knowledge yet. To accurately envision a post-internet world would take deep and broad knowledge of many aspects of human civilization, but it's not a necessary endeavour for that future to actually come about. Things are already changing based on relatively small innovations in individual lives, as well as collective groups of people working together towards certain goals (companies, startups, or even forum discussion groups). Even though Kevin Kelly might have predicted the internet to an excruciating level of detail, is that kind of predictive capability required for innovation to happen? It seems like the visions of pioneers matter, but smaller innovations end up combining through community efforts to create systematic, broad changes that are difficult to accurately foresee or control in direction. Trying to control this process too strictly might even be worse for innovation and positive change rather than better for it. 

We may already be moving towards a world where innovation is rewarded rather than punished, perhaps because startup and tech culture is spreading. Rather than spreading because of tradition, generational or social pressure, it's spreading because people find it useful and empowering. It's the kind of culture that focuses on changes a small group of people can make when armed with the modern tools of scalable software and the willingness and community support that enables taking risks. It makes individuals responsible for their fate by whatever choices they make, and it seems to be moving towards being *less risky* for founders rather than *more* risky. It does punish hubris and an ignorance of reality and what markets and people really want. In the process, it also acts as a crash-course learning environment for personal productivity and serving people in ways *they* find valuable personally. The kind of culture that enables people to set out to solve problems and view that as a worthy endeavour will naturally nurture innovation. The easy and socially acceptable problems to work on get crowded and people find more and more niche problems to solve. People get to work on problems they find interesting as more funding and support comes into place for even smaller niches. 

So what we can do to get out of our own way? One of the quickest ways to kill innovation is to seek to suppress what we don't understand. Great ideas that break our norms will often start out either seeming insignificant, or seeming very dangerous and worth actively fighting. The more we enforce rigid principles, the further we slow down innovation, but it can seem like safety guidelines are required to prevent the abuse of trust or curb rampant self-interest. I'm not sure that those problems are as concerning or alarming as the opportunity cost we face everytime we kill an idea early or squash a discussion that could have grown into something valuable for society. Figuring out how to handle disagreement and dissent is important, especially when emotions and identities are involved. As soon as we're creating environments where fear rules certain kinds of discussion, progress in those areas will be curbed. By finding ways to make those discussions less divisive and safer to engage in, we can nurture innovation and progress, even when it takes forms that concern or alarm us at first. 

When someone shows up with an idea to build something that would be difficult for us to imagine in the first place, maybe it's worth second-guessing our initial doubts or dismissiveness. I'm reminded of Seth Godin's story of missing out on focusing on working in the world wide web when he first came across it in the 90s because it seemed too slow and had no business model: nothing like [Prodigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)), a service that acted like a paid internet. Betting that free was the future, even when it was unintuitive to most, was something the founders of Yahoo! chose to do instead. And then it seems like they tried to monetize Yahoo!'s homepage far more than Google did, putting in stuff like News, links to other Yahoo! services, and selling adspace directly on Yahoo as a "homepage for the internet". So Google saw the value in being free, simple and uncluttered (for individuals using the search engine) even *more* than Yahoo! did. 

This race towards giving the direct consumer free stuff and monetizing in other ways seems to be a sore point today though. Phrases like, "If you aren't the customer, you're the product" show up in discussions around social media, data ownership, and privacy. Industries are forming around those concepts too, like privacy focused search engines (DuckDuckGo) and email inboxes (ProtonMail).

Innovation doesn't always have to be flashy like leaping from horses to cars. Sometimes it's just about going where people are and giving them what they want at a time when nobody is meeting that demand yet. With so many niches being viable though, innovators don't have to try to invent things for the masses. They can seek to serve specific, narrow audiences who share the innovator's philosophy. People creating free, open-source software can make a living doing so, and so can people creating paid, high-service, high-status software.  

A culture where change is embraced rather than resisted.
