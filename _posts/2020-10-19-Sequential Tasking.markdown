Lately I've been noticing that multi-tasking doesn't just happen when I've chosen to do multiple things at once. It also happens when I'm doing just one thing. But the way it happens is in my mind, in the way my thoughts branch out from the task at hand to other things I could do or consider doing. Sometimes it just looks like I'm frozen as I pause between actions, lost in thought, or I do some things without thinking about them and make mistakes if I haven't automated the skill or task well enough. Other times I'm doing the task but I'm unconsciously looking for ways to be distracted, so I end up grabbing any sort of distraction that passes by, like another person or a sound or an opportunity to do something else. The main downside of this is that I might spend most of my allocated time for a task actually doing or thinking other things that don't further the task itself. 

Ironically, all of this multi-tasking isn't really making me better at multi-tasking. Most of it is just very inefficient sequential tasking, but if I focused on a single task at a time and looked to improve it and automate it, then I'd be able to multi-task better in the future. Like so many choices in life, it seems to come down to investing in my future capabilities by paying particular attention *now* and prioritizing certain outcomes consciously.  

Focusing on a single task isn't just about narrowing my conscious thoughts down to being focused on something though. I can be distracted unconsciously too, and I can generally feel that happening even when I'm forcing my conscious thoughts onto one specific task. It doesn't seem like a sustainable process to use willpower to do that. So it does seem like there's some value in figuring out how to allocate attention well (both consciously and unconsciously), and take steps towards focusing all of my thinking towards one goal. Sometimes that'll mean taking appropriate breaks, or going for walks when I think I should be working instead, but it seems like a tricky thing to understand and manage well. I'll have to read about it some more and figure out how other people have solved this problem for themselves, and how much has been written about it in general. It seems linked to mindfulness, meditation, attention management, discipline, and focus. I've come across some ideas about it from different writers, like Adam Grant's article on [Attention Management](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/smarter-living/productivity-isnt-about-time-management-its-about-attention-management.html "Adam Grant: Productivity Isn't About Time Management. It's About Attention Management"), or Derek Sivers' blog post [Don't Be A Donkey](https://sive.rs/donkey "Derek Sivers' Don't Be A Donkey"). 

Some of Adam's insights are about paying attention to how one's attention is being spent and being intentional in advance about choices. It's not just about cutting out distractions, but rather about engaging in any activity (like watching TV) with intention. Adam sets conditions in advance for watching TV, such as knowing which channel he wants to watch ahead of time. If he doesn't meet those conditions, he doesn't turn on the TV until he can answer the question that fulfills that condition. We can create our own questions and conditions in advance and learn to use them well. Part of using them well also means that we're satisfied when we fail to meet the condition, because it acts as a useful moment of reflection: we can then think of an answer to the question and proceed to watch TV, or we might realize in that moment of reflection that we would actually prefer to be doing something specific that isn't watching TV. Watching TV isn't inherently bad: it's just that having no intention behind it can lead to us doing it more than we'd want to in the long-term. 

Derek's insights also seem related to the point of thinking differently such that the internal conflict is lessened or eliminated. By choosing to think more long-term, and reminding ourselves that we can focus on one thing at a time and do better in the long-term than if we were focusing on many things at once, we increase the potential to act in our long-term best interests in our day to day moments. It's a practice, but one worth undertaking. Simply getting started with noticing the moments we're conflicted and ineffectively swaying between options is worth starting on, and once we notice, we can start to take certain steps to improve it. 

Noticing these things alone might pose some challenges if it leads to feeling bad about the fact that they're happening in the first place. This is something I've been trying to figure out. What would it take to get better at noticing these problems without necessarily feeling bad about that? After all, they existed before I noticed them too. If I can turn noticing them into some form of progress towards fixing them, then I can learn to enjoy noticing flaws in my ideas, but it seems like this will need to be a continual process of learning and improvement.
