Conflict begets understanding. If I can't be curious about conflict, then there isn't much reason to get angry at it either. Avoiding conflict ends up being easier than either curiosity or anger. Avoiding it isn't always physical... Sometimes I avoid conflict by readily blaming myself and seeking to alleviate the discomfort in the conversation. Sometimes that gets me and the other person further from the truth, and further from a meaningful resolution. Blaming myself for whatever went wrong is also a way to avoid learning more about the problem in a genuine way, and it deprives both myself and the other person of the chance to figure out more about each other, and the real nature of the problem. 

Conflicts are rarely about just the issue being spoken about. It's worth finding out what the conflict means to both of us, and that can't happen if I look to end it as quickly, or as painlessly, as possible. Instead, I have to learn to appreciate the opportunity to learn and to find a way to make things better.
