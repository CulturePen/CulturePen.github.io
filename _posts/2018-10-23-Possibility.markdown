What is it that shapes our idea of possibility? How many times have we done something we thought we couldn't do? How many times haven't we realized the magnitude of something we just did? How often does the world have to prove us wrong before we start to question our ideas of "right"?

Tim Ferriss has [17 questions](https://tim.blog/2016/12/07/testing-the-impossible-17-questions-that-changed-my-life/ "Testing The Impossible: 17 Questions That Changed My Life - Tim Ferriss") that he uses to test the "impossible". What we seem to have instead are all the answers; here's why it can't be done, here's why it would be silly to try, and here's why nobody else has done it. At some point though, someone does it and we throw our hands up in the air. Of course, at first we rationalize why they didn't really do it, but rather cheated somehow, got around the problem in a way that we don't consider a solution. Eventually we accept that it happened. *Why didn't I think of that?*, we might wonder, before sighing and getting right back to our comfortable nook where we continue to occasionally think of that, but not think of the next impossible task, until someone shows us it's possible again. 

We're afraid to challenge someone unless we're sure we're right; but challenging someone and being wrong is a closer way to get to what's right, because chances are they don't know either. The funny thing is they might have just realized that too. Because we don't question ourselves nearly as much when someone challenges us and turns out to be right than we do when someone challenges us and turns out to be wrong. Why? Because nobody has ever learnt something against their will, and we're most open to learning when we feel safe; for many of us that safety is wrapped in a thick, comforting blanket labelled *right*. 

The moment we are reminded of our rightness and see someone else we empathize with shoot and fall, we imagine how we'd feel if we were wrong, and in that moment we're looking for reasons to be wrong. We might just find them too, because we're no longer afraid of them. After all, who's going to punish us for being wrong, the person who just fell at our feet? We'd much rather join them on the ground than feel alone up here, and all the better if we have a good reason. When we're genuinely looking for reasons to be wrong, that's when we can truly figure out what's right and put aside the pursuit of solving the mystery of who's right.
