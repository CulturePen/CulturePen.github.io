There are three timezones: the past, the present, and the future. The more focused you are on the task at hand, you're living in the present timezone. When you're imagining the future, setting goals, or just daydreaming, you're living there too. When you're struck by that embarrassing thought of what happened years ago, or you're just reminiscing about the past, you're living there then too. 

We don't occupy any of these different timezones simultaneously, only sequentially. We swap between them quickly, sometimes panicking in the process. When we're stressed out, we're rarely experiencing the present moment as it actually is. Emotions can certainly exist in the **present** timezone, but most of our situations of anxiety, fear, worry are based on anticipation or regret. We fear that what happened last time will happen next time, or that things will fall apart in some way.

Each of these timezones is useful but it helps to know which one we're exploring at any given time. Practicing noticing what timezone we're in is a conscious choice that enables us to structure our focus to suit our goals.

While it can be fun sometimes to get engrossed in reminiscing or daydreaming without knowing we're in that state, it can also be stressful and repetitive to get caught in loops of anxiety or guilt. Sometimes we even focus so heavily on the present moment that we lose sight of the bigger picture and we don't question our plan or direction, even when things seem off. 

Like being in a dream, noticing that we're in any particular timezone can break the illusion initially. Some of the magic might be lost for a time. But it can also enable us to control the dream. 

Practicing noticing our timezone helps us notice this and decide if we want to remain there or move elsewhere. An important caveat here is that there is no right, prescribed answer to which timezone you should be in. Being present-focused is particularly suitable when listening to someone because it can be easy to jump ahead in what they're saying otherwise. Alternatively, being future-focused can be very important when working on a business plan or analyzing a long-term decision. Focusing on the past can help you reflect and learn from old experiences. 

You might feel guilty for daydreaming or reminiscing, but feeling bad once you notice those states can be counterproductive. It's happening for a reason and unless you replace it with something you prefer, trying to forcefully focus on other aspects of time will be unnecessarily difficult. The very act of noticing without judgment helps you figure out what you want and how to get there. If there's ever a sense that you *should* be focused on something else but you aren't, that kind of motivation is what's counterproductive. When you really know what you want, transitioning to it can be planned out and practiced without angst.
