>*This may be be a bit of a broad statement, but I don't think there's anyone that I've met that I haven't created a bit of a deep relationship with. It's a really lovely thing to create a relation with people that might not anticipate that closeness. And that's kind of the light of my life, getting to be close to people.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Dove Cameron__ 

I've written before that I'd like to explore bold ideas and be wrong at least half the time, because that's the only way I can experiment and grow. I've been learning more about the psychological field of study known as propinquity, the effect of proximity and space on human interactions. I'm exploring the idea that perhaps a great deal of poor relationships and conflicted enstranglements can be helped merely by bringing the parties closer physically, which will naturally encourage more interactions as a result. At first this idea seems quite intuitive, but the reason the science behind it is so fascinating is because very small changes have been found to have disproportionate impacts, almost to the point of making me question how we could be affected by such small changes. But the data are there; moving your desk mere centimetres closer to colleague's can have a direct impact on the number of times you will talk to them. 

A great natural example on a larger scale was explored by Simon Sinek in his book *Leaders Eat Last*. His example explores previous tradition in the U.S. Congress for the families of Congress members to move to and reside in Washington, D.C., causing a natural mingling of families from both the Republican and Democrat sides. This led to a culture focused on getting things done, rather than pursuing control, as the two parties would argue hard by day and unwind together by night at get-togethers and social events. This changed in 1994 when a man named Gingrich headed the Republican party and took control, instituting a different style of policies for Congress. By prioritizing fund-raising more, Congress members were more incentivized to spend the majority of their time in their home state, inadvertantly breaking the proximity link they held with their "opponents", affecting them in ways they likely didn't foresee. As trust between the parties began to deteroriate, intentions turned more competitive than cooperative. The story then turns to a Republican Congressman and a Democratic congresswoman who were put together by circumstance on a Romanian tour, and found themselves with nothing to do for some time but socialize. Since they were on opposite sides, they had never gotten close until now, but apart from the political atmosphere, they formed a connection. That connection later grew into a very productive relationship as they began to meet together in Washington more often and discuss policies openly, with trust rather than suspicion. There were even times where one of them would vote against the party line because they realized it was the right thing to do, rather than trying to push the narrower party agenda. That small coincidence of propinquity was the basis for a long-standing relationship that would did a lot of good in the long-term. 

My summary doesn't really do the story justice and I highly recommend reading *Leaders Eat Last* as its chock full of inspiring stories like that one, highlighting ways we can work better in cooperation rather than compete to feed our egos. It amazes me to think of how such small coincidences can lend themselves to such huge impacts, and it makes me wonder if we shouldn't be socializing with the people we disagree with more. Especially on a basis where aren't there to argue with them, but simply to spend time with them and enjoy a human connection as people. Having different opinions from someone doesn't necessarily mean we can't enjoy their company. I think we take it for granted just how effective it can be to seek out perspectives different from our own, but I think it's a keystone component of growth and long-term fulfillment. It seems like life would be quite comfortable, yet tedious and boring if we only spent time with those who agree with us and make us feel smart. Perhaps it's time to seek out people who make us question our views and experience perspectives we never dared to venture into before. The beauty in propinquity is that even if we're uncomfortable at first, the more time we spend around those we don't understand yet, the better we become at building that understanding. Chances are we'll enjoy the process too.
