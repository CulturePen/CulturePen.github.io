>*Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Robert Waldinger__, [*What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness* (Ted Talk)](https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare "What makes a good life? Robert Waldinger") 

The Harvard Grant study and the TED talk linked above were some of the very first resources that set me on this path in life. It's the longest running study in the world and has studied people from childhood into old age, documenting change in their lives and how they feel, both physically and emotionally. 

The conclusions are fairly simple and intuitive, that close, trusting relationships do more to fulfil us than wealth, fame, or plenty of free time. While most of the participants in the study focused on their careers early on in their lives, by the time they reached middle age, they had gotten wise to the real contributors to their joy. 

This is part of what made me realize what it could mean to live a life built around genuine human connection, enabling and maintaining trusting relationships. One way to do that might be to find a team or company united by a meaningful purpose that resonates with me. Regardless of what we choose to do in our lives, I think it helps to be aware of the impact our relationships have on us. They don't just influence our happiness, but our susceptibility to illness, both mental and physical, as well as how resilient we are to pain and unexpected disasters. It can be just as important to bring openness and trust into existing relationships as it is to form new ones built on this foundation. 

In the chase for more shiny glory, I sometimes lose sight of this simple principle, but I'm grateful to be surrounded by people who remind me daily through their actions borne from a genuine sense of caring. I'm lucky to never have to look far to find a reason and a way to relearn this concept.
