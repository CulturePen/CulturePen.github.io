>*Success has to do with deliberate practice. Practice must be focused, determined, and in an environment where there's feedback.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Malcolm Gladwell__ 

The beautiful thing about deliberate practice is that it's a concept that can be applied to anything at which we want to improve. The difficulty lies in making that choice. It's not easy to design a curriculum with incremental goals, adapt it over time from constant, honest feedback which we must seek out, and consistently do the hard work of drilling out the underlying flaws in our mindset and skills until they are as polished and excellent as the strengths in our skills we often like to proudly display.  

It can very draining, and deliberate, focused practice can usually only be held for a few hours a day. We simply lack the mental energy to learn something in such a focused way for long, but the time we do spend pays heavy dividends. The good news is also that we get better at is as we execute it, as even deliberate practice can be practiced deliberately. The skills of self-reflection void of ego, of seeking out coaches and mentors, requesting as immediate feedback as possible and taking it to heart, seeking help to design relevant drills and exercises to focus on the most vital concepts to growthâ€”these are all skills we can exercise just like muscles. 

I even find it quite fun the more I do it. There's just something intrinsically fulfilling about knowing that the intensity and hardship of such focused practice is leading to growth in a way no other process could, and to feel that growth over time and know that the hard work matters. I have yet to find any process so satisfying in such a way, and it can be applied to anything from tennis to empathy to typing to painting to listening. The price to be paid is perhaps one of dedication and determination, blood and sweat and tears when the work melts your very mind and excellence seems like a distant light bordered by abyss. 

The choice is easy to make when I consider the alternative; ineffectiveness and mediocrity, forever bound by excuses that slow my growth. Time spent that way irks me when I look at it through the lens of potential learning and focused direction. I simply can't imagine enjoying anything that way.
