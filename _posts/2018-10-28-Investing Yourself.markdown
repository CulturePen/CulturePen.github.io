> *Everybody holds back every time, because that's what you got taught to do. You got taught to do that by your third grade teacher and by your coach and by that boss and that other boss. 'Cause if you put everything into it, they're just going to ask for more anyway. You know who doesn't hold back? Artists. David Mamet doesn't say, "Oh I've got a great line, I'll save it for a future play. I'm not getting paid enough for this play."* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Seth Godin__

 We often talk about investing in ourselves, but rarely do we talk about investing ourselves for others. Every bit of work that we do for the world is an investment and injection of ourselves into something meaningful, a work of art. Seth Godin often talks about this; an artist is anyone whose work connects others, and by extension whose actions and existence and very being connects others. We crave connection and anyone who enables it is an artist, and artists don't hold back. Artists create inspiring work by creating inspired work; the secret ingredient isn't love, it's commitment. A commitment to connecting others in the smallest ways knowing that size doesn't matter nearly as much as depthâ€”that connecting a crowd for five seconds is just as meaningful as connecting a pair for a lifetime. Art can be the email you wrote that you were reluctant to send, it can be the conversation you started that you were afraid to have, the nod of acknowledgment that you were hesitant to offer, or even the *No* that you committed to when the pressure for a *Yes* was suffocating you. 

 Investing yourself in the next moment, and the next, and the one after that is exactly how art is made, and it's exactly how people are connected. Instead of looking for reasons to hold back, let's realize that there are no reasons in the world convincing enough to keep us from offering it all.
