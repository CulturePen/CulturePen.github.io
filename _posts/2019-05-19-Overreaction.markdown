Objectively, it is impossible to overreact. There is simply no such thing. It's like saying that something is too hot or too cold. Every relative judgment we make is based on our own standards. We take this for granted far too often. Our judgments and standards are moulded by reality, but at a certain point we begin defining reality by them too. Perceiving an overreaction is one great example of that. What we're really feeling when someone overreacts is that *we* would react differently. It's the very opposite of empathy. The truth is that any reaction that someone has is completely realistic and reasonable, no matter how it makes us feel. If we feel like they're overreacting, then it's a good sign that we need to look at what we're missing. If their reaction doesn't make sense to us, then there is likely something we don't know about. The other possibility is that we have all the relevant information, but are simply applying flawed standards of judgment. As soon as their reaction happens, it makes it real, and as soon as it is real, it becomes reasonable. It means that there was some combination of circumstances, emotions, and character that was able to come together to form that reaction. If we can never imagine reacting that way, then we need to expand upon what we are capable of imagining. 

We need to account for the piece of truth and reality that just presented itself to us and redefine our perception and judgment to account for its formation and existence, rather than trying to fit the truth into our misguided sense of judgment by considering it an overreaction or unreasonable.
