Been working on a conscious checklist for myself to receive advice better. I think engaging in these steps will also make it more likely I get advice, because I'll be more open to receiving it. I'll also end up responding better and better when people test the waters by pointing out things I could be doing better. 

<ol>
    <li>Listen carefully. Pay full attention to what the other person is saying and full attention to understanding what they mean.</li>
    <li>Suspend my judgment for the moment and empathize with them as deeply as I can.</li>
    <li>Don't get drawn into my initial theory or understanding of what they're saying. I could easily miss what they're saying if I start to think I understand them when I really don't.</li>
    <li>Ask clarifying questions with an intent to understand, not defend or destroy.</li>
    <li>Write down whatever isn't sticking out to me as heavily memorable, and rehearse it internally.</li>
    <li>Figure out action steps if applicable.</li>
    <li>Run the action steps by the generous advisor if time permits</li>
    <li>Thank them and get doing.</li>
</ol>

P.S.: Also testing out what ordered lists might look like in HTML.
