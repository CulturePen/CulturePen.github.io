>*How much time does a man save if he does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks? If you are plagued by externals, it is not they which trouble you, but the importance you give them.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Marcus Aurelius__, *Meditations* 

I've always struggled with finding the right balance of self-doubt and self-trust, but I've come to learn that there is no place for self-doubt in growth. There is however a place for trusting others, but that trust needs to come from an internal calm, not from internal doubts, worries, or fears. When I trust others from a place of insecurity, I've found that I'm susceptible to take their advice too literally, or to be blind to the biases that come attached to their very well-intentioned advice. However, when I trust others from an internal sense of self-trust, I'm much more healthily receptive of advice while also asking questions with genuine curiosity and and openly exploring the biases that are tied to their perspective. 

I've been surprised by how well it works to simply ask someone, "What are the biases that could be affecting your advice here?". Often people are taken aback at first, but quickly recover and end up self-reflecting well enough to form a genuine answer, often surprising themselves too. I was always under the flawed impression that to learn from others, I had to diminish my confidence in myself, but now I see that openness and self-trust go hand in hand. It feels great to execute this concept and feel the increase it has on my measured absorption of other perspectives. 

Aurelius in this quote, being the famous stoic that he was, was referring to the internal churning and struggle caused by attributing undue importance to outside opinions and actions. I've often experienced the same struggle, but I realized I couldn't follow the solution of attributing no importance to other perspectives. Instead, I would have to build self-trust to ensure the right balance of perspective and growth, unhindered by ego. 

Self-trust is the foundational basis for building a mindset that revolves around *what's* right, rather than *who's* right.
