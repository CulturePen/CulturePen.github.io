I've been meeting some amazing people lately. I don't know how much of that is the people themselves, and how much of that is my expectation or perception now. There are so many amazing questions out there and somehow I'm stumbling across the people who are asking them. The beauty in finding people who love being wrong is that I never feel taken advantage of for being tentative. It's an interesting feeling. 

Learning feels natural now, like my default state of being, and it no longer feels like I have to force a specific kind of learning on myself. People have asked me, "What's your goal?", and my answer always seems to be, "I don't know." Absorbing other perspectives has been very fulfilling, and I've come to realize I don't need a traditional goal or vision to feel fulfilled; in many ways, it's purposeful purposelessness. I've come to genuinely believe that any conscious vision I could imagine and try to impose on myself and others will never come close to being as beautiful as the way reality pans out all on its own. When I trust the process, I often find the results I didn't know I wanted, but certainly needed. Pursuing what I wanted got me nowhere, so I'm pursuing nothing and letting experiences be. 

Maybe that's naive and idealistic, but who ever decided long-term fulfillment couldn't be fuelled by those aspects of us?
