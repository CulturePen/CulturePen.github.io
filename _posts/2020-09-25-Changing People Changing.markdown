What does it take to change yourself?

In this [YouTube interview segment](https://youtu.be/mogZP_fexfA 'Leonard Nimoy on developing "Star Trek's" Spock Character') Leonard Nimoy, the actor who played Spock on Star Trek, explains how this process of change unfolded between him and Spock. 

It started with an improvised utterance of the word 'fascinating' during filming when every other character on the ship was focused on an external threat. The director asked Nimoy to play further into that, to have Spock be curious when others were scared, to be interested while others panicked. The process was gradual and Nimoy didn't do it alone. The more he played into the role, the more the writers and producers on the team shaped the scripts and setting to support the formation of the Spock we know of today. 

The intial incident got the snowball started, with someone seeing potential in pushing it forward. People worked together after that to keep adding to its momentum. It got to the point where Nimoy was spending more time as Spock than as himself, and it changed his own character. 

He didn't do it alone, but he was enrolled in the journey. Nobody else could have done it without him, and he wouldn't have a reason to do it if not for other people. 

Spock changed because of Nimoy too. The famous eyebrow response from Spock came from a Nimoy habit, one he didn't even notice he was engaging in until the writers picked up on it. Once they put it in Nimoy's next script, another virtuous cycle was born, leading to another signature element to the character. 

Spock wasn't a faithful representation of any single person's character design, nor was Nimoy just an actor playing a role. The two people deeply influenced each other despite existing within the same mind. The two people existed within a system that changed them, and was changed by them. 

It got to the point where Nimoy was spending more time as Spock each week than as himself. That initial "fascinating" spark was only the first step. If not for the fuel added to it consistently over time by his allies, Spock would be a mere shadow of the character we admire today.

We have many first steps every day in our lives, but we don't always see them as sparks the way this director did. Interactive environments with social feedback enable us to change in ways we simply don't know how to on our own. Sometimes we change in ways we didn't know we wanted... until after we were different. 

People change us, and we change people. The choice we get to make everyday is whether we enroll ourselves in that journey to make it better, even—especially—if we don't yet know where it leads.
