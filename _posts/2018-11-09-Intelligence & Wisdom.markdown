I've been learning about the concepts of intelligence and wisdom lately. I've been fascinated by when and why we like to use them to refer to people. It also seems like I'm being called wise more often these days and intelligent less often than before, so it made me wonder if what I've been going through has in some ways been converting intelligence into wisdom over time.

Our perception of general intelligence seems to be heavily tied to a few things:

* **General knowledge, supported by a strong long-term semantic memory:** This is the aspect of memory tied to facts and knowledge outside of personal experience, stuff that didn't happen *to* us but that we learnt *about*. Interestingly enough, there are two facets to this: remembering a bunch of random stuff, and then displaying the contextual capability to remember and whip out the right random fact that fits the situation at hand so well that it doesn't seem random at all. When people ask me why I know some random fact that I just brought up, I rarely have a satisfying answer for them. 
* **Openness to experience:** People who seem open to more perspectives and experiences often come across as more intelligent to us. This is part of what we perceive as curiosity in others, as well as the perceived tendency to think about things and the strong desire to learn.
* **Divergent thinking:** This is a bit of a weaker link, but fascinating nonetheless. Part of the way we perceive and identify geniuses is when we feel like someone is onto something in the way they think, but in a way we can't fully comprehend, like their thoughts are on a different axis from ours. This ties back to the idea that Arthur Schopenhauer expressed in his quote, *Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see.* This aspect makes us view divergent thinkers who express themselves well as potentially intelligent, which ties into the last point.
* **Eloquence:** This can often be our quickest felt trait when we're sizing someone up. How well they articulate their ideas and experiences to us heavily shapes the way we measure them up,both consciously and subconsciously. It's a bit disheartening to think that there are people out there with very valuable insights and perspectives that may face tough challenges communicating with others, and have to overcome being initially pigeon-holed as "stupid" to properly transfer meaning and have a genuine, mutually respectful human interaction with a new person. A well written deeply flawed message may gain more initial traction than a poorly worded breakthrough, but the cool thing is time always works in favour of the truth (eventually).

Wisdom often comes across to us as a close sibling of intelligence, but with more subjective and ethical implications. It can be a bit more intangible at times:

* **Understanding and Empathy:** This ties in a bit to how we perceive maturity. Someone who displays the capacity to be understanding of others in tough situations where we might lose our temper or lash out at others. Moreso, someone who seeks to understand rather than impose or assume is also perceived as wise. 

* **Equanimity/Peace of Mind:** Displaying peace in a situation of turmoil is usually met with apprehension, but in the long run it is seen as a sign of wisdom because wisdom involves an understanding of the ups and downs of life and a tendency to view the long-term more intensely than the short-term. This naturally leads itself to a sense of nonjudgment and an embracing of both joy and suffering. The wise may love uncertainty as much as they love predictability, and experience both fully without fear of either. 

* **Tentativeness & Vulnerability:** Robert Sutton and Andrew Hargadon expressed that the attitude of wisdom might be *acting with knowledge while doubting what one knows*. To be tentative is to be vulnerable, and we often respect an open willingness to be wrong, to be embarrassed and to fail, while using those possibilities to fuel action rather than stall it. 

* **Diverse Ethical Understanding:** A large part of the way we judge wisdom is about tough moral situations. Think about how many stories of kings involve them arbitrating and judging disputes between their people; we often tie experience to wisdom and wisdom to judgment free of self, of ego. This involves understanding not just one's own ethical perspective and opinion, but others' as well and arbitrating results that maximize the goals of others (even if others are not entirely clear on their own goals). 

* **Self-Awareness & Honesty:** These two are linked because self-awareness is being genuinely honest with one's self. When we meet someone who is honest with us about their own features without ego, we feel that they are wise. They are also choosing to be as honest with us as they are with themselves, which strikes us as vulnerable and frankly, quite human too. It displays a certain courage that we respect and in some ways can envy if we feel guilty for not being as honest with ourselves and others, especially when we perceive that it hurts our image. 

* **A Contagious Sense of Purpose & Meaning:** This wouldn't be a blog post of mine if I didn't put something contentious in, something I could totally be wrong about. I've been toying with this concept, and while I don't personally have a strong sense of purpose or meaning in life, that attitude has been very intentional. I think part of wisdom is imbuing life with meaning and so what may look like aimless drifting to one may be very meaningful drifting to another. This is often contagious and can come across to others as a deep-seeded sense of optimism, purpose, meaning and/or fulfillment with life, even in the face of adversity or danger. Many times this can manifest itself as unconditional love for others. 

I don't think one is better than the other, and I don't think they're mutually exclusive at all, but I do find that for me personally I've found wisdom much more fulfilling to develop and steep myself in than intelligence, especially since it feels like many of the rewards from intelligence are extrinsic while many of the rewards from wisdom are intrinsic. Intelligence without wisdom may lead to what I struggled with, which was an identity built around looking, seeming and feeling "smart" and "right". Wisdom on the other hand works to dissolve identity and fuel the growth of intelligence by seeking to appropriately look stupid, seek to be wrong and understand others and oneself. It feels like they fuel each other and there's a nice balance to be had in developing both over the course of one's lifetime.
