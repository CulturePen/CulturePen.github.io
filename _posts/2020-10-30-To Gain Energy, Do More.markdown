I just spent a whole bunch of time struggling with a post and getting stuck. Constantly censoring myself and struggling to make progress. I could feel myself tiring out just from the process of being in so much internal conflict. So I saved the post elsewhere and decided to write about something else. Part of what I realized is that my first instinct when I'm struggling like that is to cut back and do less. The decision I made instead was to simply start over, do more, but do it in a way that's energizing rather than draining. Do it in a way that's fun, engaging, and less constricted. Instead of distracting myself with other work or reading, I'm writing again but doing it with more reinvigoration. 

Doing more doesn't have to mean slogging through everything. Nobody can sustain a slog forever unless they find a way to make it more energizing for themselves. The options for that are endless, but it begins with the choice to do more, not less. 

Doing more usually means doing the stuff you haven't tried yet. Sometimes that means letting go of the idea that the process needs to be miserable. If you can find a way to make it fun and get the results you set out to achieve, then that's being creative. Other times it means facing the emotionally challenging stuff. Having that difficult conversation that you've been avoiding for months but will be relieved to have had. Sitting down with something you've been avoiding for days and seeing what that feels like. Doing more means choosing more rather than letting circumstances dictate your choices. Making more choices can be challenging and draining, but it's offset by the autonomy and results gained by taking control of your thoughts and actions. In this case, it's possible I should have sat down and slogged my way through my first try at a blog post. But since I've made a choice and acted on it, I feel far more energized than I did before I felt that autonomy. Knowing that I can see how that choice plays out and learn from it, knowing that if I beat myself up over it I can learn from that too... Well it just makes it all the more worth doing more for it.
