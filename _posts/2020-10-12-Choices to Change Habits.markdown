I've got plenty of habits that I'd like to change. The first step is in noticing that they're habits. Not just habits of doing stuff, but also habits of avoiding certain actions, thoughts, and feelings. So how do I get to changing them? It turns out that there's plenty of information out there on how to change habits, but I struggle to apply much of it because wanting to change in the greatest moments of vulnerability is the hardest part. It's easy to want to change when I'm not in the middle of the circumstances that change what I want. As soon as I'm under pressure or stress, I want to get out, and I don't even question that desire in the moment. Before I even realize it, I'm already under the bedcovers and reading an ebook on my phone to avoid the thought of facing a hard problem filled with uncertainty. Making choices, especially when the outcomes are uncertain, seems to be difficult to face. And yet making choices is exactly how I'll make progress in any meaningful way. The choice to hide only gets me further from learning to make better choices. 

Habits make choices easier, whether they are formed on choices to hide or choices to face a difficult decision. The investment in changing a habit pays off by making future choices easier, and sometimes all it takes to start changing a habit is a small series of easier choices made in advance, when the desire to hide isn't so strong. They could involve setting up a schedule to try to stick to, noting down how I spend time, or changing the nature of my environment by eliminating distractions. A major part of it also seems to relate to managing my focus well to check in regularly that what I'm paying attention to is what I actually want to be prioritizing. It ends up being painful discovering that I felt busy and productive but I was really just avoiding the bulk of the decisions I found scary to face. 

It seems like the more it's a struggle, the harder things get, so finding ways to make it engaging to continue to face the problems is important. Relying purely on willpower isn't the way to go, so I need to find ways to leverage willpower at key moments while designing convenience and ease into the majority of my time spent on the problem. Introspecting honestly will be an important but uncomfortable part of the process. It seems like the more uncomfortable something is to face, the more it might be worth doing.
