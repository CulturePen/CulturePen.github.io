Spent the last ~20 hours or so in bed, experiencing some indigestion issues. I'd been through that kind of experience before but it wasn't any easier the second time. A lot of the suffering was self-inflicted rather than simply because of the pain. It certainly seemed like I had a lot of control over how I felt and how I interpreted things, even though I wasn't always able to exercise that control. Knowing that the pain would pass didn't make it any easier to experience in the moment either. The same experience, or very similar experiences, still come across as very different based on my frame of mind and how I'm viewing it. There was more curiosity involved at some points during this experience and I didn't seem nearly as pained at those points. 

One thing I realized is that the specifics of the experience and things I noticed would be difficult to remember or even talk about/write down. They seemed like such small details to even consider compared to the bigger picture of the experience, and of what matters to the world in general. I didn't know how to communicate certain sensations in words, except to use tropes like light-headedness or nausea. But those words didn't capture what I was experiencing, since I had experienced light-headedness and nausea that was different from this, so it made me wonder what other experiences people have that they can't really express in words. Even combining the words I knew didn't give me a satisfying way to explain or describe certain aspects of the experience. I came close to convincing myself that the experience I was going through must be close to the words I had on hand, rather than accepting that whatever words I had for it right now might just be unconvincing and foreign to me and others. 

Every time I learn new words that have no comparable synonyms, I feel like I'm expanding the range of experiences I can access too. Maybe this is part of the satisfaction that people describe with learning multiple languages. Learning to describe different kinds of pain gives chronic pain patients access to language and control over their experience. Learning to describe emotions in more detail helps people experience their emotions more deeply while still retaining a sense of identity throughout that experience. 

There's something about language that seems to open up horizons and I can't help but wonder what kinds of unique words we'll have hundreds of years from now. Some of those words and concepts and ideas already exist in languages outside of English, so it's only a matter of digging into them a bit to find some examples. German has some fascinating words and unique concepts. So does Japanese. Each language enables an experience in people that is unique to that language, and combinations of languages also enable certain combinations of unique experiences.
