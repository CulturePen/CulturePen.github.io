This is a very insightful idea that someone at the Women in Tech Regatta brought up, for which I'm very grateful. I often thought of hiring for a positive culture as looking for culture and value fits. Trying to find the right people for the team as it exists. What I never considered was the concept of culture add rather than just culture fit; rather than asking *how well does this person fit in?*, we could also ask *how does this person enrich our culture in new ways?* When we look at this way, new perspectives certainly open up. The last thing we want is a culture that stagnates and becomes homogenous over time, much the echo chambers we find in social media today. We don't want to be hiring people who tell us what we already believe. We want to hire people who challenge us in positive ways so that we grow and broaden the horizons of our culture. No culture is perfect, so settling for merely a culture "fit" is only second-best to a true culture addition.
