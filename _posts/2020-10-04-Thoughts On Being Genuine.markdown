A friend recently told me that I'm so genuine that I come across as ingenuine. It's linked to something I've been thinking about for two years now . . . the idea that if I decide put myself on a trajectory that involves becoming increasingly more honest to others, and increasibly more honest to myself, that I might run into situations or results where my honesty comes across as dishonesty. I've been grappling with that idea ever since, but I keep leaning towards the conclusion of, "That's a result I'm okay with" and away from the conclusion of "That's a problem". 

Something similar seems possible with learning to be genuine, and maybe the result of being perceived as ingenuine is okay. It's a short-term result, and the only reason my friend could tell me this was because he's known me for a few months and has seen me consistently say things that had no value to me or him if they were just lies. In fact, they would only serve to harm me if they were true and used against me, and they would harm me if they were false and were discovered to be so later. Basically there was no reason for me to lie or make an empty, meaningless statement in those instances. 

None of my choices were as calculated as they're going to seem like as I go back and analyze it in this blog post, but I think they did end up leading to a few positive outcomes.

By being genuine to my friend, he learnt about the consistent version of me that exists in most spaces when I'm being honest, and it was quite close to the kind of person I usually am when I'm completely alone. This means that the advice he gave me was applicable to me not just in the context of our relationship, but also in the context of my life in general. If instead I was living out a different set of values with him than I do in other places, then his advice would have been less useful and applicable to me. This is one advantage to seeking to be consistent in all areas of life, whether it's with friends, family, colleagues, work etc. 
  
This kind of consistency means that the way that others respond to me helps me improve my way of being regardless of the situation, assuming I'm being consistent. Now, I should clarify that I have noticed that I act differently around different people. I've even noticed that I act differently when I'm completely alone but feeling inspired by different mentors or shamed by different images of people in my mind. In both cases I'm the one either inspiring myself, or shaming myself, whether or not I attribute that to the effects of other people. In some sense it's the same even when I'm with someone in person. They can influence me, but I can notice the way I'm being affected and make choices that shape the future for me and that person, and our culture. It's worth being conscious about. It's worth paying attention to. 

Sometimes the choice to be made is not to spend more time with people who shame me and to try to overcome those barriers, but instead to find people who push me to be better in ways I care about long-term. The tricky thing is that this can often have very little to do with the conscious intentions of the other person. A person can want to help me, but their view of helping might be harmful to my goals or to my progress. It's up to me to figure out how to value or not value advice, help, judgment and so on. Most people in most circumstances offering advice genuinely want to help, and see the potential for good outcomes for the other person; advice is expensive to offer, especially when you factor in that it can suck to give advice to someone and then see them spurn it. It's like not getting invested in their success might have been easier in the first place. 

That being said, all of these are aspects of ideas/culture and are choices. There are certainly people who've chosen to invest in others and learned to handle them failing and to keep doing it generously, because they know that it can work and that it does make (some) people's lives better. The very process of sharing knowledge and helping others can be intrinsically enjoyable, regardless of the results, although the results can certainly sweeten or embitter our memories of the process.

The other positive outcome from my ingenuine-seeming genuineness with my friend is that we grew closer together for it. If the way that I was being was not a good fit for my friend, or the way he was acting wasn't a good fit for me, we could find out fairly quickly and go find other people to spend time with. Instead, the act of sharing and learning and being genuine helped me learn more about myself and him, and in that space between us grew the kind of deep relationship that I treasure far more than most of the relationships I've had in my lifetime. 

So the question ends up springing into my mind: What would it take to build more relationships like that? Relationships that are genuine and deeply fulfilling to both parties. It seems like maybe they're unsustainable because there's only so much time in each person's day and only so much emotional energy to commit to relationships like this. But what if it's about time invested only early on, and about trust after that? And what if it's emotionally recharging and fulfilling mutually more often than it is emotionally draining?

There are plenty of relationships where I should have taken risks and been myself, but I was afraid to be. Those mistakes still haunt me and I specifically remember many of them, but the answer is to do better moving forward, not to dwell on them and think that it's not possible to build better ones moving forward. Along the same vein, it's never really too late to reach back out and try to make amends for old mistakes of omission. The stuff left unsaid can be way worse than the stuff I said that stands out as embarrassing. The stuff left unsaid is easy to avoid thinking about unless I consciously tie them to concrete results, so the few that stand out and I can remember... must be worth fixing.
