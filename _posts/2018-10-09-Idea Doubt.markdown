>*The people who succeed the most are the people who fail the most, because theyâ€™re the ones who try the most.*

About two months ago I wrote [*this post*](http://culturepen.com/blog/post/2018/07/23/Trust.html "Culture Pen - Trust") about my struggle with self-doubt. Since then I've naturally absorbed a very different perspective; one that considers the distinction between idea-doubt and people-doubt. Adam Grant introduced this concept in his Ted talk, [*The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers*](https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers?language=en "The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers"), and I've explored it in other forms since then. 

What I was experiencing at the time was idea-doubt, an often energizing kind of skepticism fueled by curiosity and a desire to discover anew. Unfortunately, the accompanying guilt and struggle stemmed from mistaking it for people-doubt, a more paralzying form that generated anxiety and worry that I had no way of understanding at the time. 

It's starting to seem like the majority of problems, obstacles and suffering I come across is a result of judgment of some sort. In this case, I judged the doubt as potentially self-sabotaging and neglected to look at it objectively. If I had, I might have noticed that it was spurring me on to new insights and actually adding to my fulfillment; I was so focused on the social guilt associated with doubting myself that I didn't notice how much I was enjoying the experience. This idea seemed strange to me until I learnt about something psychologists have been studying for a while now: the concept of us having multiple selves, in this case specifically an experiential self that lives in the present moment (about three seconds long) contrasted by a reflective self which tells stories and builds a worldview in the form of memories. Daniel Kahneman has a great talk on this subject [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgRlrBl-7Yg "The Riddle of Experience Vs. Memory - Daniel Kahneman"). The two selves can and often do experience different levels of happiness in the same situations; fullfillment reported in the present moment is often different from the future memory of fulfillment of that same moment. 

As I've started to suspend judgment of experiences and memories and build an awareness of how fickle my worldview can really be, I've been experiencing a a perpetual peace regardless of the emotional reward or consequence from any given experience, situation or memory. It's tough to put into words but over time I hope to build a better understanding of exactly what this experience is and how I seem to have stumbled upon it.
