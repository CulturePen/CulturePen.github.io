>*Avoidance has never been a great tactic in solving any problem. For most situations in life, not addressing what's going on only makes matters worse.*

I've had issues niggle at me in the past and avoided bringing them up because I felt like it would just lead to an awkward conversation. Lately though, I've been addressing things immediately and the results have been surprisingly effective. Even more unexpectedly, the conversations haven't been nearly as uncomfortable as I thought they would be, and people have been appreciating my candour. I also find people much more willing to be candid with me in the future rather than tip-toeing on eggshells when it comes to sensitive issues. In an ideal world, every relationship we have would be this way. 

So how do we make that happen? Perhaps a good start is to choose to care enough to be vulnerable first. Invite openness and feedback and demonstrate that it will be received positively and used to grow. Avoiding tough conversations only makes them harder and harder to address, until there's a wall of resentment that will take much more effort to tear down. The scariest part is that the wall can often be invisible, our gaze drawn to more obvious but less relevant signs that we might consider untreatable. Sometimes all it takes is a series of tough, but successively easier conversations to bring it down. 

Starting relationships on a healthy foundation of openness is a great measure of prevention too. Expect zero avoidance, hold yourself and others to that standard and the world will appreciate you for it. Mole hills will never become mountains and spilt milk will be promptly washed away. Perhaps the greatest effect of all of a zero avoidance policy is the amount of peace and trust it builds in a relationship. When you know that the other person will be open with you about mistakes you make, you're freed to be yourself and take risks with good intentions. Too often we're constrained by the element of doubt, of wondering where the boundaries lie because they've never been spoken of openly nor drawn up clearly. Invite a commitment to addressing it all and clarity will be the first of many rewards.
