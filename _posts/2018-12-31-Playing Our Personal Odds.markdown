The golden rule is about treating others the way we'd like to be treated. If we flip that idea, we end up with the rule of treating ourselves the same way we treat others. That means expecting ourselves to be flawed, unpredictable or difficult to control. When we ask someone else to do something, we often account for the possibility that they won't humour our request. For some reason though, we don't extend that same courtesy to ourselves. We seem to fall prey to the belief that if we want to do something, we will. That if we tell ourselves to stick to a plan, we will. 

We don't work that way. We apply the idea of probability to the actions of others and the next step is learning to apply that same prudence to how we deal with ourselves. When we treat ourselves as flawed human beings worthy of negotiating with and incentivizing, whose motivations are worth seeking to understand, then we're much more likely to succeed the in the ways we often envision we should. 

I'm not sure why we feel like it's natural to treat ourselves as if we're completely obedient to our own will and fully predictable and understood right off the bat. Maybe it's because the alternative makes us uncomfortable, but I've been finding it quite freeing. Understanding that I'm not entirely in control means that I'm open to surprises. 

Randomness and unpredictability exist quite heavily in the real world and this is reflected well in the games we design. Contrary to popular belief, chess was not a very popular tool for generals to practice strategy. The rules never change, all information is always completely known to both sides,and both sides start with the same pieces; sounds nothing like a real war. The best games were ones that incorporated randomness, unpredictability and luck. The better strategists always came out ahead even in games that incorporated chance because they learnt to optimize around random possibilities and unexpected surprises. This was a crucial skill for any general, and I would argue it's a crucial skill for anyone living in today's world. 

Life throws plenty of randomness at us, and perhaps it's time to accept that some of that unpredictability also lies within us and our own decisions. We can't expect ourselves to be fully transparent, even to ourselves, but we can begin to expect the unexpected and plan around it. When we look up to someone for their success, it's less likely that they got luckier and more likely that they simply managed the unpredictability of life and themselves better. It's a skill like anything else.
