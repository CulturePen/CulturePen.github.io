>*“Broken pencils may be annoying, but they do not pose a grave threat to our psychological well-being and hence do not trigger our psychological defenses. The paradoxical consequence of this fact is that it is sometimes more difficult to achieve a positive view of a bad experience than of a very bad experience.”*       
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Dan Gilbert__, *Stumbling on Happiness*

This book by Dan contains a number of surprising revelations about the way our brains work. I found this one in particular very unintuitive, and I love learning things that completely blow my worldview out of the water. In this case, his concept of the intensity trigger explains situations that we intuitively feel bad about but can never rationalize or put into words. It turns out that a large portion of how we feel about incidents is dependant on our interpretation and subsequent rationalization of the event. A driver bumping into your car when you're in a rush to get to work may turn you livid when you think of their inconsiderateness, until someone yells out, "Oh my God, he's having a seizure!". Suddenly your anger is gone, replaced by concern and perhaps a tinge of guilt. In this case, the dismantling element came from the outside world when you found out that the driver might be seizing. However, our brains are rationalizing events internally. The more damaging it perceives the event, the harder it works to keep us happy and build a positive outlook. The irony in this is that it doesn't rush to our defence strongly enough when the event is perceived as minor. 

Making a small mistake at work and being pulled into your boss' office and reamed out loudly may feel awful in the moment, but immediately your brain gets to working on damage control. *Maybe she's having a bad day? Messing up couldn't possibly warrant this sort of treatment.* You might leave her office feeling shaken, but by the time you return to your cubicle, sit down and take a breath, you already start to feel better. *Yes,I'm sure she was just in a bad mood today. She'll be more reasonable tomorrow and I can explain the situation to her then. I definitely messed up, but there's more the story than she knows." You feel in control and confident that you can address what happened and work things out tomorrow. 

However, let's say it goes differently. You make the same mistake, but your boss doesn't pull you in. Instead she passes by your cubicle and makes a passing remark with just the slightest hint of snideness, "Working hard today I see." As quickly as she appeared, she's gone, and you're left wondering what that was all about. You shake your head slightly and get back to your work, brushing her words off.

Or so you thought. Her worlds niggle at you and you find yourself unable to focus on your work. *What did she mean? I know I messed up today, but it couldn't possibly be about that... she'd talk to me directly, right? Maybe she was just trying to be encouraging?* Your brain doesn't perceive the incident as very traumatic or anything worth making a fuss about, so your psychological defence mechanism doesn't kick in. Your brain doesn't work hard to rationalize the situation, so you're left feeling the full brunt of the event instead of seeing it through the rosy lenses of optimism. 

This mechanic is also responsible for incidents where we see someone else go through a traumatic incident and we feel bad for them, sometimes worse than they feel themselves. Because we're not accounting for their brain working to make them feel better, we often have a misperception of how they're really feeling and can end up coming across *too* sympathetic. If we were to actually experience the same event as them, our brains would rationalize it well enough that we'd feel better than we think we would. This is part of why we're so bad at affective forecasting, which is predicting our emotional state in the future or in response to certain events. We have a hard time accounting for this often overlooked factor. 

A good way to combat this is to communicate and clarify more often and with more vigour. We don't want to feel vastly better about a situation than we should (We would make unrealistic decisions), nor do we want to feel worse about a situation than we should (We hinder learning and beat ourselves up). However, simply getting someone else's perspective can help to align our responses closer to reality. It can also be a good rule of thumb to spend more time consciously working on repairing small mistakes or confrontations, realizing that their impact is probably more than we expect.
