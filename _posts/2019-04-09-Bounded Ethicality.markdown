There's this interesting idea that our brain has a limited capacity of storing and processing information, which is why many of our decisions stem from shortcuts we take, known as unconscious biases. More recently I've come across the parallel idea of bounded ethicality; that our moral decision making and judgment can also be affected by these unconscious shortcuts. We may think we're being objective, but really we're being influenced by multiple unseen forces. We will often favour ourselves over others, even if we think we're favouring both equally, and we're likely to make decisions that make us feel better rather than decisions that are objectively more effective, even if we have a way to measure the outcome ahead of time. 

The challenge is realizing that as long as we have human brains, we will have human limitations, and the key to managing them well is understanding that they exist and working to better understand how they function. If we can learn to be okay with this reality, we're more likely to admit to ourselves when our biases are getting in our way or causing us to unduly hurt others.
