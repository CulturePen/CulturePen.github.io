>*What I've learned is that life is a balance between idealism and realism.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Peter Hook__

I've been given the opportunity recently by someone I met to question some of my beliefs and really reflect on the ideals I often take for granted. That self-reflection spurred a few thoughts on the subject of reality and ideality.

If it's a realist's role to see the world for what it is and use that perspective to help it flourish and organically grow its boundaries from within, then perhaps it's the idealist's role to see the world for what it isn't, but what it could be, and to work from the outside in, always redrawing the lines in chalk but never ink. If the realist dives deep into their own self to find who they are and plans and structures their life to best synergize with that, then perhaps the idealist sees themself only for who they aren't, perhaps who they could be, and spends a lifetime in the chaos of constant change approaching answers but only finding more questions. Maybe that chaos is their very purpose. 

The world needs a balance to grow both from the inside and from the outside. We all spend different phases of our lives in different modes of realism and idealism, finding our own equilibrium between the two for the stage of our life that we find ourselves in. I've been asked many practical questions about what it is I'm pursuing in life, what my purpose is, and it's been a tough question for me to tackle. I might spend the rest of my life finding out. I very much enjoy the writing I'm doing but I also feel a certain emptiness, the kind that feels like it comes from isolation. I think I need to find a way to be a part of something bigger than myself, to contribute to a cause larger than my own individual one. So when I'm looking for a company or a team to join, I'm not just looking to see how open they are to change from the outside, but also how open they are to changing me, so that somewhere in all that purposeful change we find insightful, potentially perspective-shattering growth. Popular culture, perhaps inspired by realism, seems to shy away from pursuing change, especially inspiring change in others and the world, instead encouraging satisfaction and contentment with reality. However, I genuinely find that some of my most fulfilling and deeply satisfying moments are ones of immense change in myself or having a positive impact on the lives of others. Perhaps that is an idealistic trait. 

I think this is where the popular literature might disagree with me, that changing oneself isn't a noble cause to pursue, but I'm starting to feel like intentionally changing the way I think and feel over time is one of my core values. It's a pursuit that defines who I am as a person, and I don't think it'll ever disappear over the course of my lifetime. I used to think that pursuing change meant a dissatisfaction with things as they are, but I've found that as my intentions shifted, I've begun to pursue change out of a passion for experiencing new perspectives. Rather than fight any specific ideal or perspective, maybe my cause is to fight stagnation and comfort in myself. I don't know if I can find others who feel similarly, but that's what I'm going to have to search for or create somehow. Perhaps that is my purpose for now.
