Welcome to my blog! I'll be covering different aspects of personal growth here and exploring great company cultures in Vancouver, BC. I love reading books as well and will be reviewing many of them here. If you have any suggestions for content or resources I should look into, feel free to email me at Vamsi@culturepen.com and I'll be sure to check them out. 

Thanks for accompanying me on this exciting journey!

#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
