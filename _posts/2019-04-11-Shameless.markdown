The word is usually thrown around as an insult, often in an accusatory or derogatory tone that reeks of superiority. And yet it seems to me that our fears of shame, embarrassment and rejection in the eyes of those we respect are what hold us back from trying, failing, and indeed succeeding. Unfortunately, these fears can also cause us to hold back on displaying empathy, compassion or support in times when we genuinely feel those emotions. We might even deceive ourselves about how we feel, succumbing not only to a fear of embarrasment to others, but a fear of embarrasment to ourselves. We end up imposing a standard of thought and behaviour that makes us miserable. The worst part is that it's so insidious and beneath our awareness that we would never deign to acknowledge it and call it out for being about as bad as Orwell's fictional thought police. We judge ourselves for everything we do, as well as everything we considered doing, and then feel a sense of hollowness and regret for much of what we didn't do to avoid this judgment. 

Perhaps it's worth considering the value of shamelessness. If one were to wear it as a badge of honour, there would be very little stopping them from doing what they believe to be right. Maybe that's a double-edged sword, but I'm curious what it would look like. At what point does something matter enough to us that we're willing to be embarrassed, shamed, or ridiculed for it? Something worth considering when we're teetering on the precipice of uncertainty and have to choose between our emotional comfort and our moral principles.
