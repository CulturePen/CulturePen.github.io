There are choices we see people make that just make no sense to us; a belief someone might hold or a reaction someone might have that makes us think, *I can't understand that, it makes no sense. I may never get why they are that way.* These ungettable moments are amazing opportunities for us to explore perspectives completely foreign to us. 

The next time something feels impossible to understand, take a moment to consider that it might be the perfect chance to hone the skill of understanding. Ask yourself what kind of reality would it take for someone to make this choice and be reasonable in doing so, no matter how crazy the circumstances or reality may seem. It may surprise you just how close to truth it can be, and when you approach someone to ask and learn with this openness, they are much more likely to be able to be honest with you and themselves rather than fit the mould of society and justify their behaviour in traditional terms.
