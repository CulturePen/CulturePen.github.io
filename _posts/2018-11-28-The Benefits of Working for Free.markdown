I've been thinking about this lately and I've had different conversations with friends around the subject of working for free. It seems to come down to the unconscious psychological implications that come as part of any pay package. It doesn't really matter what people really expect of me, only what I feel obligated towards, consciously and unconsciously. Funnily enough, the more I'm paid, the harder it is for me to be honest, even if I view my job as being honest. It's not just harder to point out flaws in systems and choices around me, but also to be honest about my own mistakes and flawed habits. The more I'm paid, the more encouraged I am to lie to myself and rationalize my mistakes away while magnifying the perceived impact of my successes. I think we all do this, and it seems like a major barrier on our paths to truly growing as human beings.

So I'm going to run an experiment. It won't be perfect, but it's bound to teach me more. I'm going to find a fulfilling job and I'm going to insist on working for free. It'll be interesting to see how that feels and maybe I really will be more productive, more honest, and more fulfilled. Maybe I'll feel freer to be genuine, to care about people before the results I may feel my job demands, and to prioritize the long-term aspirations of the team over the immediate pressures of "emergencies". 

The beauty is that I will wake up every morning wanting to go to work because it's intrinsically fulfilling and rewarding. If that starts to die down, then I will be encouraged to bring it up and find a way to fix it, because otherwise there's no reason to stay. There's no paycheque keeping me settling for less than fulfillment. Maybe it will be hard to find a company that finds this a worthy way of living. Or maybe it will be easy. I don't know yet, but it's certainly worth a shot. It may just shape the way I live the rest of my life.
