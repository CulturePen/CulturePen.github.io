Innovation happens in leaps, but there's often an entire unseen incremental process of growth that took place in the minds of the innovator(s). Thinking up ideas while taking care not to censor themselves -> testing those ideas/getting feedback from reality -> being wrong and then learning from the failure to then think up a new, better idea -> repeat until the idea works. 

A few pitfalls: 

* A success that's small enough to be satisfying and cause complacency and the stifling of learning/growth (like "good is the enemy of great")
* A failure that puts the innovator out of the game by causing them to give up on trying new things or depleting their resources enough that they don't want to try again once they've rebuilt their resources
* The innovator mistaking a specific instance of successful innovation as being a replacement for a process of continual innovation 

What traits might counteract the pitfalls if one wants to be a continual innovator? Whatever they are, they can be learned if people want. We're all capable of these to some degree, but wanting them enough to work on cultivating them is the hard part. It'll depend on each individual's context to figure out how much they want to improve at any of these and what their personal opportunity cost will look like. Some potential traits: 

* Being unsurprised at being wrong. 
* Enjoying failure in the larger context of long-term innovation and success. 
* Being temporarily incompetent when learning new things.
* Willing to question one's intuition and seek un-intuitive sources of inspiration and progress. 
* Open to taking risks, but willing to calculate the long-term impact of a risk and take risks that won't put the innovator out of the game for good, even if things go wrong. 
* Pushing forward once committed to a particular risk and seeing it through the inevitable difficult part before deciding to quit. (Seth Godin's book [The Dip](https://www.amazon.com/Dip-Little-Book-Teaches-Stick/dp/1591841666 'Seth Godin's The Dip') is great to explain this concept)
* Identifying and minimizing or quitting other activities that aren't relevant to the innovator. 
* Understanding themselves and setting up personal systems that help them get where they want to go in the long-term. 
* Particular word traits and definitions (with some redundancy): 
  * Resilient (Keeps trying)
  * Trusting (Sees the best in people and doesn't miss out on opportunities to be helped by others by taking risks)
  * Trustworthy (Is worthy of being trusted. This trait heavily ties into the effectiveness of the above one)
  * Win/Win (Creatively seeks outcomes that create mutual benefit rather than believing that business is necessarily win/lose or a zero-sum game. Knowing Win/Wins are possible increases the odds of looking for them in the first place.)
  * Honest (Doesn't lie. Doesn't hide information that they know would be relevant to the other person. No lies by ommission, and strives to be honest with themselves and notice and root out self-deception as an ongoing practice.)
  * Curious (Interested in understanding the way things work. This interest is domain-independent.)
  * Generous (Seeks to spot and fulfill opportunities to create value for other people. Relates to Win/Win, but Generosity has to do with understanding that plenty of Win/Wins can't be seen in advance and it's worth helping others, especially in ways that relate to the innovator's interests and area of innovation.)
  * Brave (Acts despite fear. Doesn't mean fearless, but it does mean acknowledging any fear that might exist and finding ways to solve that fear and act rather than avoiding the fear and holding back. Also applies to acting in the face of anxiety, worry, shame, guilt etc. The action can just be introspecting and learning from the failure to make continual, gradual progress rather than get stuck)
  
The list above is just a starting point, and not all of the traits need to be present for someone to be a successful innovator. They're traits I'm striving to build myself, and it's worth focusing on just one to try to improve significantly at a time. By focusing on one trait or aspect, hiding from failures of that trait becomes difficult. If I decide to focus on being more honest, it becomes significantly harder to justify the times I lie to myself or others, since I'm on the lookout for those moments. It becomes easier to spot my excuses, although there will be plenty of excuses that I don't notice or that I'm not aware of (self-deception). <br>
The act of making that decision enables one to set up to move forward with purpose and perspective.
