As options open up in the world, maps become less relevant. They can even begin to hold us back from discovering uncharted territory. Step by step guides are comforting but also limiting. The prevalence of maps has created a culture where we look for markers wherever we go, trying to make our own map through life to guide our path. We miss out on a variety of opportunities that don't fit our idea of deserving to be on our map. Our sense of safety on charted territory served us well in less complex times but in today's world maplessness may help us more. When we can be comfortable exploring uncharted territory, comfortable trying something regardless of how many others have done it before us, we become better orienteers through life rather than hikers following a trail. There are more trails than ever in today's world, but also more uncharted territory than ever before. Our options are nearly limitless, but our capacity to explore them is only as limitless as we work to make it.
