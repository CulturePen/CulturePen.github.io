Whenever we set out to try to do or learn something, plenty of things are goign to get in our way. failure is inevitable. It's success that's rare and precious. Failure is the default outcome, and success is only possible when reality and our attempt clash and there is simply no outcome possible except for what we wanted to happen. The vast majority of attempts will simple fizzle out because nothingness is infinitely more likely. When realiy doesn't get in our way, often other people will discourage us anyway. They're the second layer to push past. As very young children, we're generally quite immune to failure. A toddler feels the sting of pain when she falls over while attempting to walk, but she gets up and tries again. She doesn't feel shame for failing. But as we grow up, we learn to feel the sting from reality and the shame from society. We start to doubt and judge ourselves and we become our own worst critics. We start to give up long before we begin and most of our attempts just become unsung dreams. 

That's why I think one of the most wise aspects of eastern philosophy is nonconformity and independent thinking. If you can't start by learning to trust yourself, even when the entire world disagrees with you, then where can you start? Reality is incapable of lying to you, but people and society will always do so. Reality can be misinterpreted but its results are consistent as long as your attempts remain consistent. People aren't consistent and they can manipulate you based on their own shifting agenda. Becoming too focused on people is destabilizing and distorts your relationship with reality. Pleasing people when taken too far means that you'll start to clash with reality, and that can be very painful. The essence of nonconformity is being reality focused rather than people focused. 

What dreams are you holding back on because you're afraid not of failure but of shame?
