>*When there is no enemy within, the enemies outside cannot hurt you.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; African Proverb__

One of the heaviest obstacles in our way on the path to growth is our own judgements of ourselves. The concept of being your own scientist and subject was introduced in the book *Change Anything* by the same team that worked on *Crucial Conversations*. They took a deep dive into how some people accomplish their self-change goals, while others don't. It turns out that the key is to realize that you're human, that you're subject to the influences around you, and to work to observe and modify those influences rather than rely on willpower or personal strength to overcome them. 

Too often we make it most difficult for ourselves when we most often need the process to flow smoothly. My favourite takeaway from the book was that when you're trying to set good habits or improve at something, it's important not to take failures or lapses personally. Treat yourself like a subject in a study and impartially observe the elements that led to the lapse. Then patch them up just like a third-party helping someone overcome difficulty. Say you notice that you most often break your diet when you've had a stressing day at work and stop by the Wendy's on the way home to grab some comfort food, but you feel guilty every evening afterwards. It's not weakness to take that observation and decide to change your route home from now on. We might have been taught that the strongest people don't succumb to their external influences and instead are carried through by titanium willpower. We were taught wrongly.

It's time to acknowledge our humanity and rely on the true strength of observing and converting the negative influences around us into positive ones. We're much more likely to succeed when we treat our behaviour as the target of change, when we're on the same team as as ourselves and our allies facing the opposing team of negative influences and poor habits. 

Our greatest allies sometimes don't even realize how they enable our bad habits, but I've found that bringing it up is key to converting them to positive influences. The more I communicate with friends about the habits I'm trying to break, the more I find their actions support my goals rather than enable my current behaviour. The more I try to fight the silent fight myself, the harder it is for them to understand what I'm going through. Speak up and know that the people who care will make it easier for you, each in their own way.
