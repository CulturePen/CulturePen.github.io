Chances are you aren't the first to think of an idea. That doesn't necessarily devalue the thought, but it does seem like we like being first. Of all the people who think of something, only a few of them will write about it. And of those few, even fewer will actually execute on the idea. I don't support the prevailing thought that action is always better than thought or discourse, but if you want to be first, it's generally the way to go. Each of them have their place and work together to build the world we live in. A few thoughts alone can inspire actions down the road that seem completely detached. We don't always get to see the impact of our thoughts or words but it's there. Actions are more tangibly connected to results, but that shouldn't be an excuse for us to think, speak, or write less than fulfills us. After all, fulfillment's what we're all after. It's less important how we sustain it than that we do.
