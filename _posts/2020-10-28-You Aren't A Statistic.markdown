You aren't average. You aren't typical. Not at everything, and certainly not at the things you choose to be extraordinary at. Using the word 'choose' makes it seem like it's always conscious, but you've chosen to be extraordinary at many skills. Consider your interests, hobbies, the things you like to think about or do. Done more than most people, you will end up extraordinary at any of these things. It's an open-ended list, filled with skills we don't even have names for yet, as well as skills we don't consider skills yet. 

It's fine to look at the failures and successes of those who have tried to achieve the same things before, but don't consider yourself average. Seek to find out why the average is the way it is. There's always advice out there that can help, but seeking it out is a skill. Sorting through it to find the advice that will help you in your context is a skill. Testing it, applying it, learning from the application... all skills. All improvable. The beautiful part of all of this is that this very process is already extraordinary. Engaging in it is already extraordinary. Anyone can be extraordinary, because it's not about breaking all the averages. It's just about picking one and getting started. You've already chosen some. You're already extraordinary in ways you might not realize yet. In the very process of realizing that, and choosing to focus on and expand on the skills you care about, you become even more extraordinary.
