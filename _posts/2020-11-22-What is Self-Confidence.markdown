What's the kind of self-confidence worth striving for? Is it just knowing that I'm right in a given situation based on my expertise? Probably not. 

Is it knowing that no matter how wrong I might be currently, I can figure it out and be right enough to keep making progress? Seems closer to a kind of self-confidence worth striving towards. I've often been concerned that self-confidence as a cultivated trait can get in the way of learning and self-improvement, but I'm starting to see a longer-term approach that might be better. Knowing that I'll always be wrong in ways I don't expect to be, productive self

Much of the advice I followed at one point revolved around "faking it till you make it", like learning to make eye contact and appear more self-confident. This was useful in the short-term, but also made me question the long-term benefits of misrepresenting myself that way. It felt dishonest. The real value I gained from this advice was realizing some of the incompleteness of "faking it till you make it" style advice. It worked partially, but I didn't think it was a complete solution. Another part of the self-confidence advice I read and followed involved admitting mistakes openly and being clear about what I don't know. This aspect turned out to be more directly useful as practicing it taught me that much of my fear of admitting weakness or making mistakes was not necessary. Most of the time, people were glad I admitted a mistake, and even when my worst fears of being incompetent materialized, I realized it was far better to discover a real flaw in my skills earlier rather than later. 

This is scary advice to give myself even now because so much of career success and reputation seems to be based on the impression of competence and the confidence that goes along with that. Despite many of my positive experiences with admitting mistakes, I still seem afraid of the bogeyman of looking too incompetent or fumbling about. Every learning experience involves being incompetent at something and seeking to avoid all public or semi-public moments of incompetence only dampens that learning. It can also be difficult to notice and prioritize areas of improvement  The answer there is to then read, practice, and try to improve as much as I can to build real competence (rather than just social sanction or the appearance of competence). I think this is harder to do than it sounds, but it's far better a direction to continually follow than the "fake it till you make it" path. 

On the other hand, imposter syndrome is certainly worth combatting, so it's important to strive to match my results to reality and not overestimate or underestimate my competence at any given skill or task. I've varied between the two in the past and rather than looking at it as a balancing act between two extremes, I'm starting to look at it more as a technical problem of breaking up specific skills and choosing areas to improve consciously. Every individual's life has led them to a unique combination of skills, both in their career and outside of it. Every skill has an ethical path to learning and applying it, and that path is always evolving. Skills that might seem distasteful might just be getting a bad reputation from the most public aspects of the field (like sales or marketing). Skills learned in any particular career can also be applied to other career paths or industries, and career paths aren't as narrow as they might seem. Writing, podcasting, research, editing videos, creating or optimizing websites, understanding people's problems and defining them along different axes... These are all skills that can be learned, improved, and applied for results. Honestly documenting my aptitude at various skills and comparing them against different industry standards can help build a more accurate picture of my existing skills and where I'd like to improve on them. 

After those thoughts, I now think that perhaps self-confidence is about prioritizing the accuracy of my judgment of my current skills compared to reality. By putting in specific effort to understand not just what skills I have, but also how those translate into value for others in different situations, self-confidence can be a way to expose that measurement to others proudly and continually improve upon it based on feedback. In some sense, self-confidence can help give stability to the overarching system so that no individual mistakes or problems destabilize my individual identity or potential for progress. 

Oddly enough it seems like I can't have built a very good system if some of the greatest periods of progress in my life have been sparked by an actual destabilization of identity and a shaking of foundations. That kind of destabilization doesn't seem sustainable in the long-term and I figure there are ways to improve things while still remaining stable, functional, and happy. Self-confidence might just be one piece of the puzzle to figuring out that way of living.
