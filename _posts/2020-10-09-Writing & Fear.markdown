I came across this idea from Seth Godin that the key thing for someone to get writing is to get out of their own way. That if one knows how to type, then one could type out a (I think 200 page) book in about a week. 

I thought about that and looked up the average words on a page (300) and average typing speed (44wpm), and realized that's true. A person typing at 44wpm could create a 60,000 word book in about 23 hours of writing time. That would be about 4.6 hours of focused typing time per day for five days in a row, or 3.3 hours per day for seven days in a row.

Most of the time spent writing a book today isn't time spent typing (or even writing it out with pencil and paper, if one chose to do that). Perhaps the story we tell ourselves is that most of the time is spent researching, discovering ideas and shaping them, and doing the hard work of presenting something for the world in a way that does the world justice (or does the idea justice, because the idea deserves it.) This is true, but I don't think it's the full story, at least not for me. For me a lot of that time is spent waiting. Waiting for an idea to choose me, rather than for me to choose an idea. And once I start writing, I find myself censoring my thoughts as I write, holding back on certain wording, phrasing, or entire ideas because I'm afraid. 

But I don't even notice the fear unless I'm paying attention. What am I afraid of? It's a vague fear, not specific, but perhaps it has something to do with putting an idea out there that isn't polished. A piece of writing that doesn't serve a specific, consciously chosen purpose, that isn't written for a specific audience. In short, a piece of writing that isn't consciously designed. The fear also has to do with worrying about what people will think far in the future or how I will be judged for what I write. What if I'm misunderstood and misjudged... or even scarier: what if I'm perfectly understood and then accurately judged? What if I write what I really think and it turns out I'm clearly broken, immoral, evil or otherwise defective? 

Well, despite consciously thinking that I can change my ideas and views and learn to be better (making it OK if I was wrong about something contentious 3 years ago or 3 days ago or today), I'm still afraid of being outed as a fraud or an imposter, whether that's in terms of my moral ideas, my social standing, or my employability. That fear is worth working on because it's the same kind of fear that makes it difficult to speak up and say something when I think things could be better, even to two or five people. It makes it difficult to do something when I think things could be better, and it makes it easy to make excuses like, "That's the way the world is. Trying to change it is futile." Sure, there are times speaking up will get someone genuinely harmed in ways they would want to avoid, but that's not generally the case anymore. Most of the time, the cost of holding back is just higher than the cost of speaking up. The cost of learning to fit in is that it becomes harder to change things. 

I'm noticing it again, where I hesitated on that last sentence for a good minute because I was afraid of writing exactly what I was thinking. I was even afraid to admit to myself what I was thinking or consciously hear the possible thoughts as a voice in my head. 

Ultimately it's a long-term process and one I consider worth chipping away at. That's what a practice is, and *wanting* to stay committed to a practice can be the more meaningful initial challenge more than actually engaging with it once it's a habit, a commitment, a reality. Making it that kind of commitment means that the fear becomes a reason to keep trying rather than a reason to give up. It becomes a reason to understand the fear rather than run away from it, because there's something worth understanding the fear *for*. A reason to be afraid and act anyway.
