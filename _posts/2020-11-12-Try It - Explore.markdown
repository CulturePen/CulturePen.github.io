When you have an idea or a whim, look for a way to test it out. If it feels risky or dangerous, look for a smaller way to get started, but try something along those lines. You can always build on it later or cancel at any point, but once you get going, you start to get a much better sense of how enjoyable that path is. The longer you can intentionally delay investing so much that you feel like you can't quit (delaying the sunk cost fallacy), the more you can test it out free of pressure or commitment. 

When you go to test something out, what are the emotions involved? Do you start second-guessing yourself? Is it a mix of hesitation and excitement? The experience you have when you try something is going to be indicative of your intuition. While there's plenty of value in following your gut in certain situations, trying things that seem intuitively uncomfortable is a great way to stretch and explore options you might not even know work for you. As long as you've defined your safety within certain bounds and you can treat it as an experiment, the experience becomes one within your control but not completely familiar. 

Exploring the unfamiliar and stretching out what you find familiar is how growth happens. Keep building on that unfamiliarity as it grows familiar and you can discover some very rewarding projects, skills, relationships etc.
