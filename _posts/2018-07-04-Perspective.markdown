There is no real secret to happiness. All the useful knowledge we have on it is out there. We know that happiness can be helped along by money (up to a certain point), and we know that it's satisfying to make progress towards a goal, although it requires continual progress to keep that sort of dopamine high going. 

We also know that the longest lasting and most fulfilling happiness comes from close, trusting relationships with just about anyone. I've written about genuine human connection before, but despite everything we know about happiness, we're very likely to make decisions that leave us feeling unhappy. This is largely because when we see other happy people, we're quick to attribute it to the factors we can easily see and measure: Driving a fancy car, running their own business, travelling to exotic places often and so on. 

All of these things can contribute to happiness, but they don't fuel it nor do they sustain it. We have to dig deeper if we want to understand the reality of the situation, and one of my favourite things to do recently has been to just ask them. One pattern that surfaces is that they're not often as happy as they seem, but the beauty of the happiness they do feel is how much it seems to stem from the people they surround themselves with. Their deep, open relationships with close friends, family and colleagues. 

I think it's quite natural for us to be able to, and even seek to forge trusting relationships with all kinds of people, but that intention will never be clear if we're worrying about manipulating or being manipulated. Until we shift our priorities from the conventional ones we've learnt to hold sacred like power and money, our agenda will always look cloudy to others and ourselves.  We'll never be able to truly trust or be trusted. What we've learnt wasn't taught directly to us, but it's what we've attributed to the success of those we look up to. 

When we do learn of role models with integrity, we chalk up their success as an exception to the rules and say that they've gotten there because of luck or talent, despite their "soft" morals. The world wouldn't treat us the same way if we tried to do what they did. We glance up at them, only momentarily lest we be blinded by the sun, then  shift our eyes down and continue to follow the rules we think are the only way for us to be happy. How could we ever be like them?

Well, we already are. We just have to rise off our knees to stand up straight, brush off the years of dust long settled on our shoulders and follow ourselves to the ends of the Earth as valiantly as we would follow our greatest role models.
