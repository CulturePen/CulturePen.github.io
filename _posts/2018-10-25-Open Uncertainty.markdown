Uncertainty always exists. The choice we're given every moment is whether we choose to embrace it or ignore it. The longer we spurn uncertainty, the blinder we grow to it. Our culture lauds certainty, sureness, confidence and insistence. What if we lauded uncertainty, tentativeness, idea doubt, and receptiveness? What would the world look like? Some of our deepest fears stem from isolated uncertainty, held back by our cultural fear of being openly uncertain. It's liberating to be able to respond to  the question, *Are you sure?* with the answer *I never am, but here's why I think this makes sense*. 

Most companies see uncertainty as the enemy and predictability as the friend; it's why we build systems, checklists and procedures to guide people. Unfortunately far too often people become slaves to their own constructs and begin to view the rules as physical, real limitations. We don't hire people to follow the rules, but rather to know when to break them. Whether we like it or not, uncertainty will always exist in the world. When we choose to embrace it, it becomes an open part of our discussions and often multiple perspectives contribute to solve problems instead of a few working in isolation unsupported. Instead, we choose to bury it, to wear masks of certainty and sureness, thinking that's what the world around us wants. Well, the world doesn't know what it wants, and what matters is what you want. How would you like to feel about uncertainty? You might find when you embrace it that the people around you appreciate that and come to feel the freedom to do so themselves. We think rewards are tied to confidence and certainty, but if uncertainty and tentativeness teach you more, it's clear where the real rewards lie (at least to me). 

It's a choice. Open uncertainty, or isolated uncertainty. There is no certainty; only dishonesty to ourselves.
