So much of the value of experiences in life comes from observing how we respond. Not the actual way that we respond, but just noting how it happens. Effective self-help authors have to figure out how to offer advice that can be interpreted by the reader in a way that helps them address their own unique situation. Teachers, therapists, mentors and parents all have to solve a similar set of problems too. The problem of helping people change themselves in ways they want to change. Putting myself in new situations or under new pressures exposes the gap between what I say I want and what my actions portray as my priorities instead. Exposing these mismatches can be done in many different ways and we don't have to go out of our way to create them: they're basically everywhere if we're willing to look for them. The key is to look at the many possible mismatches that could be exposed and consider which ones we care most about. It's an intentional, thoughtful process that helps solve the problem at hand *and* builds towards self-understanding in the long run. 

As an example: Observing how I respond to a deadline exposes my tendency to procrastinate. A friend of mine has solved this for himself by creating a habit and system of doing everything early to get it off his mind. When I try to implement his method, it helps to notice how I respond. The more I treat it like an experiment, where any outcome is fine as long as I'm recording it well, the more my priority shifts towards observing and recording results rather than trying to force certain outcomes. This has two main advantages: 
<br>
 1. I feel less bad when I fail to accomplish some specific outcome, such as meeting the deadline. This means I'm more likely to keep paying honest attention to what I'm doing rather than lying to myself or avoiding looking at certain parts of my behaviour because I judge them as "bad". 
<br> 
 2. I can repeat experiments with minimal emotional friction. Even when I fail, I can guess at some factor that made it hard to succeed, change it in some way I guess is good, and then try again. 

In this specific case, I failed to treat it like an experiment I gave up once I started to fail at following a schedule to get things done everday. I ended up giving up on recording the data, and gave up on trying to run the experiment again. One way around this is to set shorter and shorter deadlines, like checking in every hour. By getting used to my negative emotional reaction to small failures, I can also start to treat them as learning moments rather than beat-myself-up moments. By prioritizing this factor of "observing how I respond", lots of options open up in how I structure my day and structure my observations of that day. Failure becomes an opportunity to get closer to success rather than a reason to be discouraged.
