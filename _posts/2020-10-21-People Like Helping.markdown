It's easy to think of help as a sacrifice from the helper but it's often more meaningful an exchange than that. Especially when it's not a transaction with clearly defined expectations. The gift of helping pays back in its own way, but it's hard to measure and hard to predict. We've learnt what it's like in more subtle ways, and have ideas about karma and paying it forward, so ultimately it can feel great to help someone, especially when it changes them for the better. 

Letting people help also means taking on the posture of a student. Of someone who can't do or know the right things now, but is grateful to have the help of someone who can. And sometimes the best kind of gratitude is wholeheartedly changing for the better, and even becoming more independent from it. People like to help, they like to change others for the better, and sometimes they like to have been needed just enough to not be needed anymore. Besides, participating in being helped is as much a skill as helping others.
