Put it into practice. Whatever the idea is, find a way to try it out. The more the idea comes up in my mind unbidden, the more it's worth acting on, even if the execution is just a way of putting the desire to rest. Putting it into practice can release that constant pressure far better than more thinking usually will.

I have at least three draft emails I keep finding myself rewriting in my head, often when I least expect to be thinking about anything like that at all, not because I consciously choose to but mainly because I just haven't sent them out yet. Some of them have been around for months. The structure and content of these draft emails has changed so much that they're nothing like the original communication I had in mind. No doubt as soon as I start actually typing them out, they'll change even more. How much energy am I sapping from myself on an ongoing basis by not writing and sending these emails out? And in the broader category of ideas that exist in my mind that I haven't either let go of or put into practice, how many exist unconsciously, having the the same effect?

These are genuine questions because I don't actually know what my mind would be like if it wasn't filled with these unfinished drafts. I seem to fill it up with more drafts as soon as I send those emails out or put the ideas into practice, but maybe that's what the process should look like for me. As long as I don't get stuck, maybe it makes sense to always have a few drafts in my head. Perhaps they only really start sapping my energy when I ruminate on them for weeks or months and avoid acting because I'm afraid of the outcome. At that point, no amount of reassurance or rumination will really guarantee a successful email or blog post or whatever else it might be. I figure there's a sweet spot somewhere in between where having ideas on the go is energizing rather than draining, and I can find connections to them in my daily experience that shape them without internal fear, guilt or angst. 

Running away from the fear of putting something into practice is only really a recipe for long-term regret. Simply deciding to let go of any particular idea or draft hasn't really worked for me, so the easier thing to do is to get used to implementing and shipping. Focusing on the choices I do make and the things I go get done will help deal with the knowledge of all the things I've thought about but haven't really done.  

P.S. The last time I wrote about [Valve's Employee Handbook](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf 'Valve New Employee Handbook - 2012) [was back in June 2018](http://culturepen.com/blog/post/2018/06/24/Err.html "Culturepen - Err"). I reviewed it again this morning and it looks like they've had to face and address a very similar problem:

> **What about all the things that I’m not getting done?**

> It’s natural in this kind of environment to constantly feel like you’re failing because for every one task you decide to work on, there will be dozens that aren’t getting your attention. Trust us, this is normal. Nobody expects you to devote time to every opportunity that comes your way. Instead, we want you to learn how to choose the most important work to do.

Do you treat yourself with the same gentle understanding of the challenges of facing opportunity costs? I know I don't. Our lives are filled with these challenges, and we can either ignore them or acknowledge them. Learning to choose the most important work to do is an ongoing process, not a one-and-done deal. Valve understands and intentionally applies this, but most of us don't learn to *keep learning to choose the most important work to do.* 

Seth Godin has a [great blog post](https://seths.blog/2010/12/the-worlds-worst-boss/) on this idea as well. Companies have had to figure out ways not just to enable employees in the moment, but to also grow them in the long-term towards their own goals. 

The same concepts and solutions apply to any individual life. We're all leaders of ourselves. The easy, but often unsatisfying, way out of facing these opportunity costs is to instead give up agency and autonomy. To follow a prescribed checklist and path of what's promised to be safe, guaranteed and predictable. The difficult and rewarding path is to acknowledge that if you don't make a choice for your own reasons, that choice will be made for you instead. Whether by culture, social pressure, or simply someone else stepping in and directly deciding for you. It can be tiring to exercise agency, so start wherever it energizes you. Expand on it at your own pace and for your own reasons.

Companies that enable employees to operate with agency aren't new in concept or execution. They know it works far better than command-and-control. Many of us have learnt not to expect that kind of freedom from most situations. But it's always there for the taking in every moment of every day. What would it take to start managing ourselves in the same way we'd be proud to run an organization?
