My colleague in the room yesterday pointed out that the insights I was describing were "meta-cognitive". That I was pushing beyond the layer of conscious thought and picking out patterns of subconscious judgment and habits that were singlehandedly responsible for swaths of external behaviour and reactions. We were exploring the very foundations of why certain thoughts were easier and certain thoughts were more difficult. It was a first for us as so often before we would get caught up on each instance of behaviour and treat it like an individual problem rather than an interconnected web of issues all rooted in a set of beliefs that were so implicitly real that they were truth to whoever held them. 

Questioning the truth is very difficult for someone to do, and I could see the toll it was taking for someone to question the beliefs they had built their identity and life upon. It is certainly a process that takes time and a gradual understanding. The key to going beyond the symptoms was to continue to question intent until we arrived at the very base of how someone valued themselves. The very qualities that they believe make them who they are, and that they will go to the ends of the earth to defend. Once this truth was found, we began to see ways it could be flawed and just one interpretation of reality. We realized that it had been so implicitly believed for so long that it had just become a part of every conclusion, never subject to doubt. In that room, doubt became both our greatest ally and our greatest enemy. I'm not sure what emotions it must have brought up, but it is certainly something to understand better. I feel like this process can be refined, to be much less uncomfortable and much more intuitive, but for now I could feel the discomfort of the room at having to face these doubts and questions without the shield of their ego. A lifelong companion, putting down that shield must be one of the greatest hurdles for an individual to overcome. Perhaps it isn't something to be done all in one try.
