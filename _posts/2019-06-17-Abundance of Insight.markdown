I used to get so attached to insights. They would hit me at the most random times and I'd scramble to contextualize them for memory or write them down or share them with someone before that initial spike of realization wears off. These days there's such an abundance of ideas that they can hit me and I can let them go without any remorse or regret knowing they'll circle back around in some form or another eventually anyway. The stuff I used to take for granted is being iterated on so heavily everyday that I can't really stay attached to any particular beliefs or perspectives anymore. Everything's up for grabs as I explore everything I can. 

The interesting feeling that's come up lately is that unfamiliarity and feeling lost are starting to become comfortable states of existence. I'm no longer scrambling for the most reasonable explanation to cling onto when I'm in freefall. I've grown content to keep falling as options present themselves for a moment and flit by. The old desperation for something familiar or believable is nowhere to be seen now.
