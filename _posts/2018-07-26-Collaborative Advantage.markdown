>*To be an objective leader means aligning your models with the needs of an organization. There is no question anymore that collaboration, seeking out diverse perspectives and developing new ways to look at challenges and opportunities, is a key leadership competency.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Elizabeth Thornton__ 

One of the first things I learned at my last job was the concept of competitive advantage. Not just in theory, but in how we pursued it with our objectives and daily behaviour. We considered ourselves the holders of a certain advantage built over time from our experience, processes and general skill at what we did. The problem is by viewing strengths through that lens, it can be easy to fall prey to the trap of independence and a self-sufficiency mindset. 

Imagine viewing your strengths and advantages through the lens of how they can fit in with those of others to amplify results and deepen perspectives. The reality is most companies that compete with each other often have very similar goals, and could benefit from cooperation rather than undercutting and budgets spent on one-upping each other. Attitudes like that hurt the industry, consumers, and the companies themselves most of all. I found a great example of this mindset in Satya Nadella, Microsoft's current CEO, which he details in his exploratory book *Hit Refresh*. When he succeeded Steve Balmer in 2014, in a move to change from static to more dynamic and enduring goals, goals that would drive their behaviour on an everyday basis rather than aim for a single point of achievement, he replaced their original vision statement of *a PC on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software* with *empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more*. When I first read of this, I noticed how that statement didn't speak only of Microsoft as a beneficiary. I was skeptical at first, after all, CEOs are going to put their organization first right?

This was about a year ago and I was under a very flawed mindset, one that thought of benefits in terms of a zero-sum game, that if Microsoft were to gain, some competitor in the industry somewhere would have to lose. Therefore to empower everyone would be inefficient. Thankfully, as I read further into the book, my mindset began to shift as I started to realize his words weren't just empty platitudes. Some of his very first major acts as CEO were to break barriers of communication Microsoft had put up with its competitors over time and start to work collaboratively with them to launch products that would lead the industry. I began to see how empowering ones "competitors" not only helps your own organization, but helps make the world a better place too. Certainly much moreso than trying to snatch market share away from competitors. Microsoft has seen tremendous growth under his leadership and its relationships with other industry giants have improved substantially, paving the way for a much smoother future in computing. 

A lot of the best mindsets are not the most intuitive, and it's natural to feel like we're losing something when we see a competitor gain something. What if we shift our perspective though, and start to view competitors as potential collaborators, looking at how we can maximize gain for everyone involved rather than just ourselves? That shift in perspective is what will lead to the most creative partnerships and solutions that feed into long-term results rather than short-term benefits at the expense of the world. If our goal is to do the best for the world we live in, we'll have to think and act more collaboratively.
