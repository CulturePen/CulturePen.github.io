It's difficult to overstate its value today in my life, but it's something I've been conflicted about over the last two years. I'm experiencing on a daily basis from Seth Godin's writing and podcasts and talks, and I think it's one of the hallmarks of a great teacher. Putting my experience into words that transfer the emotion and meaning well to a particular reader is its own challenge though. 

Encouragement is not the opposite of honest feedback, or tough-love, or anything of that sort. We notice encouragement in how we sometimes treat children and [encourage them](https://twitter.com/ASKthefoodanth1/status/1309541772343771138) to follow their dreams, to build towards their potential, and do what they believe in doing. It's beautiful to see. 

But we don't treat ourselves the same way, and we often don't treat other adults the same way. I'm not sure why that is, but it's a subject that's interested me ever since I was in elementary school and could see that teachers treated kids differently based on how closely their interests matched the ones encouraged by the status quo. At some point between kindergarten and the end of elementary school (for me), the environment seemed to change from one that valued individuals to one that valued conformity. 

The teachers I had were a varying but major influence on my early understanding of the world. Each teacher had their own life and hopes and dreams, and their own worldview of children and what their job meant to them, but each of them also had to work within the confines of their school's culture and expectations. 

Great teachers seemed to draw energy from their job, most days, and on the days when they couldn't, they somehow still seemed to have a well of encouragement for the students who relied on their advice, perspective, and guidance. 

All of the below applies to figuring out how to encourage yourself in productive ways for your situation too. The net effect of encouragement ends up relying heavily on the receiver's context, who they are at any given moment in time, but that's no reason not to try. It can even be a great reason to try and to 

**Encouragement is:**

* Seeing another person for who they are, what they are going through, and telling a story that helps them get closer to what they want. Seth writes about this as the difference between ethical and unethical marketing, where an ethical marketer persuades someone to make a decision they're glad they made in the future. That helping them put their own long-term interests ahead of their short-term interests is something they appreciate. 
  * The opposite of this is approaching someone with our idea of who they should be, or should want to become, without empathy for who they currently are and what they currently want, and trying to change them based on what we think they should want rather than what they actually want. 
* Offering people tools to apply to their own context and situation in ways they find useful to achieve their goals. These tools can be ideas, resources, inspiration... anything that makes it easier for the person to repeatedly make progress themselves in the future, in ways they care about. 
* Showing someone that what they *want* to be possible but aren't sure is possible actually is possible, and can be done. The worldview I've ended up building over the course of my life has excluded so many things as impossibilties or not worth trying to achieve, and I didn't even realize that was the case.

As Seth puts it, turning lights on for people is what great teachers do, and I'm realizing encouragement is one byproduct of that process of turning lights on. It's not a factory process, and you can't write the steps down to turn the lights on for someone, because ultimately they're doing the work and thinking for themselves... the person encouraging them is only making it easier, and I think that's why Seth also uses the wording, "Opening doors for people". 

People still have to walk through opened doors. Nobody's pushing them through, but an opened door is also a window into possibility and what could be. A closed door is generic, and we know how to walk past closed doors. But once someone opens a door we never paid attention to, the sights inside may just tempt us to step in and try it for ourselves.




**Daily Acknowledgement:** My greatest ally and encourager of late has been my friend and coach Neo. From his perspective he hasn't done anything special, but from mine he's opened plenty of doors and is just waiting for me to step through the ones I prefer, or to open more doors myself. He didn't try to be a teacher, but he ended up being a great one for me because he didn't try to change me... he simply showed me, through his actions and stories and life, that I *could* be better, that better was possible, and that I could strive rather than settle. 

Instead of pressuring me to be more like him, he's chosen to help me start to understand and get closer to my own goals. He's also created moments where I might question my goals, where I might change in ways I'd be glad (after the change) to have changed in that particular way. He doesn't let me lie to myself or make excuses, and I'm still not sure how he manages to do all of that while still keeping things light-hearted, fun, and engaging. 

Perhaps none of those factors are really in conflict with each other. Maybe it really is possible to create all of those things in a relationship and simply live that way without angst or strain carrying it out. By observing and practicing it, I can figure out how to be a better teacher to myself and others too.
