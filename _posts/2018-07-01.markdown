>*Right or wrong, I was committed to doing whatever I thought was best for Santa Fe, the Navy, and the nation without worrying about the repercussions. I called this the paradox of "caring but not caring"â€”that is, caring intimately about your subordinates and the organization but caring little about the organizational consequences to yourself.*       
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Cpt. L. David Marquet__, *Turn The Ship Around!*

I stole the title from Gus Levy, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs, who coined the term to describe the culture he encouraged at the firm. To me this idealogy does a good job of describing an effective approach to change and doubt. Today's quote is from a book by a former Captain in the Navy who was assigned to lead one of the worst performing submarines in the force at the time, the *Santa Fe*. It was his first time captaining a ship, but from past experiences under other Captains, he had realized the value in having authority as a low ranking soldier. He immediately opened up a discussion with his crew to figure out ways to push power down the pyramid and change the status quo. Captains at the time were expected to give direct orders and make every important decision. He and his crew tried something different, relying instead on trust, genuine caring, communication and learning moments to be effective. He faced plenty of doubt and skepticism from his superiors, but he pressed on because he believed in what he was trying to accomplish. In under a year the *Santa Fe* went from being at the bottom of the fleet to being at the very top in almost every metric, all by going against every established rule and principle the Navy had set forth. 

My favourite part of his approach is that it wasn't just about maintaining the best submarine crew possible. He also helped implement initiatives to help each and every crew member with their personal goals. He pored over test data and created a spreadsheet to show his crew the most important aspects of their learning to focus on for advancement within the Navy's testing and advancement system. They also worked together to implement cross-training initiatives, so that navigational officers could get weapons training exercise to do well on that part of their tests, and vice versa. They went out of their way to create well-rounded crew members, and while it may have measured up to be inefficient in the short term, the results paid off in the long-term. The *Santa Fe* ended up having the highest reenlistment rates, promotion rates, and most impressively, more crew members from the *Santa Fe* went on to become captains themselves than any other submarine in the Navy. 

Do what you believe will yield the best results in the long term, even if the short term results feel rocky and unsetting. By all means, take in feedback from the present and shift your course to align yourself better, but always do so from a place of aspiration and passion, never from fear or doubt.
