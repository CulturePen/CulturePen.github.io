Every judgment and measurement holds its specific meaning within its context. You get to notice and influence the context of your you or your work as other people see it. Someone judging a small business owner against other small businesses they know about will come to very different conclusions than someone judging a small business owner against a Fortune 500 company. The same applies for judging that small business owner against someone who's a solo freelancer. There is no universal "normal". There's just what we view as typical within any given context. You get to present any story you want and prioritize whatever aspects of your work that you like. When you notice that people are placing your work in contexts you don't want it in, you have a choice to redefine the context or to find other people. The first step is realizing there's a context, and knowing that it's extremely malleable. Many people let the external world define the context of their work while thinking that's the final say. 

Seeking to notice the context someone has placed your work in also helps you understand exactly why they might be viewing it so differently from you. The story you tell about your work is as much a part of the work as anything else. The work is worth an audience that cares, and if it doesn't resonate, then you can understand and change the context of that work, or future work. You might also decide to choose a different audience that is more aligned with the context you've defined. 

The mistake that's easy to make is thinking that a contextual judgment is a universal one. There will always be a context that your work can thrive best within.
