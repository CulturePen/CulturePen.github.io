I keep coming across ideas about the value of routines and consistency in life. Seth Godin shares the story of how Isaac Asimov worked: writing every morning from 6:00 AM to 12:30 PM. He didn't get up from his typewriter during that time and he didn't stop writing. If he wrote gibberish, he would leave it for the editors to deal with. He wasn't attached to perfect writing, but he was attached to the routine and the commitment of writing during those times. It's a great system to address fear and it really forces me to answer the question, "What's important to me?". If I'm willing to say something matters greatly to me, but I'm not willing to make it a consistent habit, does it really matter that much to me? 

Routines don't need to revolve around single-minded focus to something specific. They can also be tools to structure my time effectively for my own goals. Designing a routine and looking at how I spend my time puts me face to face with what I actually value. Not what I say I value, but the choices I actually make everyday, whether conscious or not. Routines automate certain aspects of our lives for us too, reducing the amount of mental energy we exert while carrying them out. We can choose to think about other things while executing them. This is why morning commutes can seem to fly by with no specific recollection of any individual trip, even right after engaging in it. The difficult part can be accepting the reality of how I currently spend my time and energy. There's a way to stretch towards spending both my time and my attention better, but it will take continuous work and unwavering intention. The ineffective way out is to settle for small changes even when I can sustain bigger ones, but any progress is worth repeating. The ability to change habits and routines is itself a skill worth building, and I don't buy the idea that it gets harder with age. I think it gets harder with lack of practice and with a growing acceptance for existing routines. Accepting existing routines is fine; if I tie my shoelaces well enough today, I don't need to put a bunch of effort into learning to tie them better. But lying to myself about the end result of my existing routines is unacceptable. That's the factor that I have to change. 

The same knowledge that helps us change physical routines can also help us change routines in our thinking. This is part of what CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) ultimately does: identifying undesirable patterns between thought and behaviour and changing those patterns to change our habits. There are plenty of factors in the world outside of our control, but our routines and habits aren't among them. Our circumstances can make certain changes more difficult, but never impossible to make progress towards.
