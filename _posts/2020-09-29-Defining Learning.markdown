All learning involves change. Changing who we are in ways we like. The kind of learning that happens when we're afraid, stressed, or feel like we have no other choice... isn't the same kind of learning where we're enrolled, interested, engaged, and creating and connecting the ideas necessary to change ourselves. 

When we push people to conform and fit in, we also push them to question less, create less, and ultimately contribute less.  

When learning is defined as a process of memorizing, repeating, and conforming . . . It's no wonder that most learning turns into a means to an end rather than an instrinsically enjoyable activity. Learning becomes a chore, an obstacle to overcome to get to what we want. Change also becomes scary, mainly because adapting to external changes usually requires learning. 

But some people choose to define learning as a privilege. Yes, A life-long journey, and also a moment to moment way of being. A voluntary and continuous process of self-directed change.

It's the kind of redefinition that anyone can make, and it's contagious.
