>*The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.*

I came across this Chat with Traders <b>[interview](https://chatwithtraders.com/133-james-king/ "Chat with James King")</b> a few months ago featuring James King, the former performance director at Mandara Capital, a commodities trading company based in London. He came from a sports psychology background and applied many of the same principles to improving employee performance at Mandara. There were many fascinating aspects discussed in the chat, one of which was the idea that we're always living in one of three zones. I ended up making a summary to put up in my office to remind myself of the concept:

Ideally, you want to spend as much time as you can handle in the stretch zone (making sure to avoid fatigue or burnout), since that's where the majority of long-term learning and growth happens.

I found that over time, more and more of the activities that used to put me in the stretch zone at work started to only put me in the comfort zone, so I had to seek out more challenging and uncomfortable work. Unfortunately, the nature of my real estate job made that difficult since it relied on the repetition of tried and true techniques to achieve predictable results. Fortunately, that meant that I was able to find ways to get into the stretch zone by learning more about good cultures and working on ways to improve our culture. Since this also involved challenging my boss on our current methods, it moved me out of my comfort zone and forced me to learn to tie together empathy and conflict; Genuinely caring enough to make people uncomfortable about our problems. I'm very grateful to the freedom they gave me to do that. I ended up spending more and more of my energy on the culture work and my boss and colleagues always made it clear that they appreciated my efforts and were open to learning and teaching me more, even though it wasn't directly related to real estate. 

They enabled me to spend more time in the stretch zone at work, which accelerated my growth exponentially. In many ways I feel it's everyone's individual mission to seek out and find ways to immerse themselves in discomfort until they find themselves comfortable, then to do it again. Taking it a step further, when you find others open to discomfort, you also become open to finding ways to enable others to do so too, like my colleagues did for me. It's a self-catalyzing cycle as the positive influence they had on me now enables me to inspire and encourage others the same way, allowing them to do the same and so on. 

Seek out discomfort and you will find that those mere moments will serve you, and everyone you touch, better than a lifetimes of comfort.
