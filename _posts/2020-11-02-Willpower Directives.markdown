You only have so much willpower available per day. You can practice concentration and willpower to build more, and you can sleep and relax more to replenish it. But to start, you'll want willpower to serve your goals rather than anyone else's. Here are a few directives for deploying willpower effectively:

<h4>Deploy willpower to define the problem and goal as well as you can in advance.</h4>
This is important to do because it helps future efforts stay focused around what matters to you. The clearer the goal, the easier it is to identify when efforts are succeeding or failing, making subsequent adjustments more enjoyable to implement.  


<h4>Deploy willpower to build environments for yourself that make willpower unnecessary.</h4>
**Example:** Let's say you've decided to cut refined sugar out of your diet. Deploy willpower to avoid buying sugary snacks at the store (and especially at the checkout where they are tantalizingly laid out to encourage an impulse purchase). This is difficult, but acts as a willpower investment. Later on at home, you'll have less cravings simply because there are less reminders around. Given enough time, you'll find alternatives and the cravings won't even take the same form anymore. At one point for me, broccoli started to taste sweet because I hadn't had any sugar for months. At that point you no longer need willpower to avoid sugar, because you've structured your mind and your life to function perfectly well without any. Willpower becomes obsolete for that goal and you can deploy it elsewhere. 

<h4>Deploy willpower to build schedules, routines, rituals, and habits.</h4>
**Example:** Let's say you want to get something done everyday, but you just do it ad-hoc based on how the day goes. "Playing it by ear" is a common expression for that. If playing it by ear gets that task done consistently for you, then there's no problem there. Personally I find that it takes me willpower to switch between priorities, so setting specific times for something helps me get into the habit of doing it regularly. In my case, writing a blog post every day is a priority, and doing it right when I wake up is the routine I'm working on putting in place. It takes willpower to notice I'm avoiding the blog post and reading other things, and willpower to bring myself back, but the more I do it, the easier it gets. Eventually it'll be a habit that takes no willpower to maintain, and I can deploy that willpower elsewhere. 

<h4>Deploy willpower to eliminate pressure.</h4>

It can be easy to underestimate the pressure of many distractions, mostly because we learn to view being affected by them as a weakness rather than a normalcy. This can lead to ignoring or suppressing them as legitimate problems that can be solved. This directive's a bit more flexible in what it can apply to. You can eliminate social pressure by turning off phone notifications, or time pressure by setting a timer if you're worried about spending too long on a task. It's worth tracking how much pressure you're feeling and taking some guesses at reasons behind it. Rather than dealing with that pressure in the moment each time, you can start to apply willpower to structure the situations to minimize the pressure.

The point of using willpower in these ways is to make as many decisions as you can in advance. Making these decisions in low pressure situations enables you to execute them in high-pressure situations with less willpower than if you had no plan. Executing them becomes a matter of directing willpower towards sticking to your plan, instead of having to use willpower to create the plan on the fly *and* stick to it immediately.

All of the above does require viewing barriers as real obstacles requiring intentional design and action to solve. If you view them as character flaws in yourself, progress will be a slog. If instead they are just neutral obstacles to understand and overcome, then deploying willpower becomes a creative, engaging process. Think of it like a resource management game. You're already using willpower throughout the day, so this is just about making that a more intentional, planned process in whatever way suits you.
