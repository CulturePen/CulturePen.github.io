>*"I have seen many successful people fail after they start fearing they might lose what they have built."*       
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Guy Lalibert√©__ (Co-Founder, Cirque Du Soleil)

I've written about risks before, and the long-term costs of avoiding them. Today I was thinking about a different style of safety, one that we've become so accustomed to that we might not even see the value in living outside of it.

So much of the advice I was given when I was younger revolved around safety. *Always have a backup plan, hope for the best but prepare for the worst* and my favourite, *don't leave your job until you find another*.
I was taught this idea that life is just a series of safe havens, jumping from school to school to job to job to retirement. That happiness is reserved for vacations and old age, and the rest of life is spent saving up for them. At some point those safe havens just became hotter and hotter frying pans that I found myself leaping between, desperately following the previous generations' formula for success and wondering why I wasn't satisfied.

At first I thought there must be something wrong with me, that I must be crazy to be unhappy in a stable, secure career with an endless ladder to climb up. The modern dream, right?

It turns out I was wrong to think I was crazy. My biggest regret is doubting the way I felt and letting that doubt keep me in my place. For so long I heeded the age-old advice and tried to play it safe, lining things up before ever taking a risk. But one day epiphany struck and I realized I had everything to gain by leaving, and everything to lose by staying. Ironically enough, financial safety and security was what was holding me back from really doing what I loved. It kept me just comfortable and sedated enough that I couldn't quite put my finger on why I felt discontented inside. 

Now I see that the day I took that leap and left my safe haven for literally nothing concrete was the same day I truly became myself. The difference that day made in my life is immeasurable, and it's the first day in many that will constitute the rest of my life. Not the life that anyone else wants for or expects from me, but the life that genuinely represents who I am. I definitely would not have taken the risks that I did and been as genuine as I am if I spent any time or energy on a plan B. All that matters is plan A, and I have no doubt I can carry it out. The only obstructions that will stop me are the ones I allow, and when I allow them to stop me they transform into excuses instead. (Casey Neistat introduced me to this concept through his very inspiring video [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3s0--LcgQw "Casey Neistat's NO EXCUSES"))

No more excuses. No more backup plans or safety nets. It's time to do what's best and nothing else.
