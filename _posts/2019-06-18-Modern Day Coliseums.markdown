1900 years ago in ancient Rome it was perfectly natural to look forward to a day at the Colosseum to witness the clash of steel and spilling of blood. Today we get that some of that fix from sports such as boxing. Admitting this of course may be somewhat taboo. Rationally we may be in it for the human spirit and the noble duel of martial artists in honorable combat with fair, reasonable rules to keep the process humane. Emotionally and subconsciously however? Who knows.

What fascinates me is that revelling in the physical suffering of other human beings as grown less culturally acceptable, but we do love our fair share of emotional suffering. As our culture has shifted from one of nature and God driven circumstances to one where we are all equal at a human level and can all achieve success however we define it, our judgments of individual choice have also shifted. We feel worse in unfortunate circumstances because it reflects poorly on our character if we cannot clamber our way out of the hole somehow. And looking down at someone else struggling and failing to clamber out of the same hole we pulled ourselves out of with sheer determination and grit can make us feel especially merited. We deserve what we've achieved; we've earned it. They're trying but failing for the same? Well perhaps they should try harder. This form of social and emotional sadism is quite culturally accepted, if only implicitly, and it's interesting to wonder if perhaps 1900 years from today, future civilizations will look back on us and wonder at how we could be so barbaric. So savage and undeveloped to lack the empathy and perspective to understand suffering and circumstance outside of ourselves, so blinded by our own pleasures and superiority that we failed to perceive the seemingly obvious irony in our anthill overlooking the masses. 

What might future acceptable culture look like to make our present day acceptable culture seem barbaric in comparison?
