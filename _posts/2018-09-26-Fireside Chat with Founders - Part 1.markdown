>*Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn’t.* 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Mark Twain__, *Following the Equator: A Journey Around the World*, 1897

I had the lovely opportunity to volunteer at the Fireside Chat with Founders event this morning as part of Vancouver Startup Week. I'm sure I'll end up writing more about the event in the future as it was a very unique experience that leaves me with much to reflect on. I have a feeling that part of the uniqueness of the experience and energy in the room was because of the hosts and moderators from Spark Creations. It wasn't just how they interacted with everyone in a way that encouraged openness, but also how the panelists and hosts seemed to embody the very values they were speaking about, which ended up infecting the audience with the same kind of uplifting peace of mind. I know that personally I was a very different person in that room than I am right now, writing about this memory.  I can't exactly put a finger on the specific reasons yet but I look forward to understanding it better over time. 

I realize now that I could write an entire post about *how* the panelists spoke and behaved that gave us a strong sense of what they stood for as individuals before even getting into any of the specific words they spoke—So that's exactly what I'll do here. 

The common factor they all exuded was a sense of patience, understanding and wisdom, with a dash of excitement and genuine passion mixed in. I spent much of the time learning to take photographs and observing the audience for opportune shots, so it was interesting to notice how my attention was often pulled away by their manner of speaking even when I couldn't focus on the content of their responses. In many ways it was quite alluring. 

I got the sense that each of them had been through unique journeys but had crossed so many common points between each other along the way. Their individual demeanors and styles of thoughtful response were distinct, and yet there was a consistent, seemingly effortless synergy between them. It makes me wonder; Is there some common layover point that most people on this journey of self-discovery and growth find themselves drawn to, before splitting off and continuing their journey in their own unique direction again? Is it possible that the shared discoveries they had made about themselves and others were related to this common layover point they all experienced at some stage in their lives?

The shared sense of human value in particular was just palpable. I could feel myself being drawn into a space of joy and optimism and open perspective. The very values they stood for seeped into the fabric of the room and seemed to shape our thoughts and questions throughout the experience. I couldn't have imagined a more surreal fictional experience, so I'm still really surprised that it actually happened. But, as Mark Twain mentioned, reality can be stranger than fiction because fiction has to make sense.
