Many of our judgments are hidden even from ourselves. This idea struck me when I randomly read that Martin Luther King Jr. had started a pillow fight with other civil rights leaders an hour before he was assassinated. It just struck me as something I wouldn't have expected from the kind of person I thought he was, which made me realize that I had always made an implicit judgment that an accomplished, "serious" man is somehow unlikely or incapable of also being playful or enjoying pillow fights. It's the kind of judgment that I had taken for granted as true until the image was shattered by new information. 

We make these judgments all the time without realizing it. If we choose to be aware of them when they're shattered, we get key insights into associations we've implicitly learnt, like successful civil rights leaders aren't the kind of people who would enjoy pillow fights. In this case the judgment seems fairly innocuous, but many times we judge those close to us in ways that pushes them to fit our expectations. This pressure can often come across to them in strange ways, even if only subconsciously. By facing our hidden judgments we also face some our deepest tendencies when it comes to labelling those around us. Questioning their validity can be the first step to forming new, more fitting ways to perceive and catalogue our world.
