This is a fairly well known and intuitive fallacy where we put too much weight on the opinions of well respected or well liked celebrities or public figures. This even applies when we value an expert's opinion more heavily than anyone else's outside of their field of expertise. We also tend to implicitly believe that our smart or intelligent friends must have more well-researched or well-founded opinions or beliefs than our less intelligent friends. Similarly, those we attribute good intentions to or uphold as moral saints are more easily believed as having more valid beliefs or opinions.  
The problem with this implicit bias is that intelligence, expertise or even having the moral high ground or right intentions does not lead to an immunity to human bias. 

The largest blind spot though is that we often fail to realize that we are our own largest celebrity. We consistently value our own opinions higher than that of any other average person's and by default we consider ourselves above average unless there's evidence that explicitly suggests otherwise. We take our own good intentions and specific skills or expertise and translate them into all sorts of other fields and opinions the same way we might incorrectly prioritize a celebrity's opinion. It's harder to build an awareness of this because often the assumptions we make aren't assumptions to us; they're just reality. Even when we underestimate ourselves or consistently put ourselves down, this bias is fuelling those beliefs and preventing us from questioning our own capability to make accurate judgments, whether they are positive or negative about ourselves or the world around us. 

The first step is to begin questioning the assumptions and beliefs that we so easily take for granted. Run them by other people and ask them to point out every possible flaw, even if its a very remote possibility. Glossing over the remote possibilities that our assumptions can be smashed by is exactly how we turn beliefs and assumptions into reality, and just becoming aware of those flaws can allow us to be tentative and learn from reality rather than simply mould it ourselves.
