>*If you limit your choice only to what seems possible or reasonable, you disconnect yourself from what you truly want, and all that is left is compromise.*       
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__&mdash; Robert Fritz__, *The Path of Least Resistance*

We often turn to compromise when we feel we have few other options. We may tell ourselves that we're doing it for the other person or that we value the relationship more than winning. We may have the best of intentions and feel that we're being humble by compromising, that we're taking the longer term view.  

But humility isn't thinking less of yourself; it's thinking of yourself less. By compromising, we come to an agreement in the short term, but we commit a long term disservice to ourselves and the people with whom we compromise. Compromising does take some courage, the courage to put someone else's needs ahead of yours. 

But genuinely seeking a win-win takes even more courage, the courage to understand their needs as well as yours, and the courage to foresee and act on the fact that a compromise will always leave at least one of you dissatisfied immediately. And in any long-term relationship, whether it's between family, friends, or spouses, dissatisfaction is what breeds resentment and contempt. It's always a gradual process, and it often begins with compromise.  

To sit down and say openly, "Here's what I really want, and here's what I worry might happen if we can't come to an agreement that meets my needs. I want to understand your needs and worries and commit to meeting both our needs and addressing both our fears."

There's almost always a way to make that happen, especially when you boil the disagreement or negotiation down to the core elements of what both sides really want, as well as their biggest worries. The hardest part is committing to discussing that win-win when it feels like there's no way that one of you can leave without compromising. It can be a difficult mentality to cultivate, but the results are well worth it. The first step I think is realizing that most relationships and agreements aren't zero-sum games. There's plenty of creative ways to get what you both want and neither of you has to lose out on anything to do it. 

Perhaps the most rewarding element of succesfully navigating around compromise into a win-win is the trust and confidence it will build between both winners. A relationship built on a foundation untainted by compromise will weather many other storms. It's always hardest to do the first time, so start by applying it to something small, with minimal risk and see how it feels. 

Personally, I'm going to try this the next time my friends and I are debating dinner choices. We often end up torn between two options and either flipping a coin (Probably compromise) or ending up with someone who wants Italian defecting over to the Sushi side to break the stalemate and avoid further conflict (Definitely compromise). My friends are probably going to hate me for this, but what if we took a few extra minutes to discuss why we want the kind of food we're asking for (Are we just picking our habitual choice, or are we craving something greasy, or is it the specific atmosphere we want to experience?) and who knows, we just might find that there's a place that gives us all what we want. Maybe we just had to dig a little bit deeper to find it. I'll let you know how it goes.
