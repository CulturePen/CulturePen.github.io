YouTube videos contain a single image preview known as a thumbnail. Sometimes this is a single frame from within the video, but often creators put together graphical work and create a custom thumbnail to represent the video. It gives viewers an idea of what to expect from the video, and is often colorful and engaging with bright, bold text and eye-catching imagery. 

Our own human thumbnail previews aren't very different. We build and represent identities of ourselves to the world, and we interpret and store the identities of others for ongoing use. The way that we build the images of others depends largely on our beliefs and experiences, and the way our own identities shape themselves are also dependent on how others respond to us. This Thomas Cooley quote captures the idea well: *I am not who you think I am; I am not who I think I am; I am who I think you think I am*

We are deeply social animals and our need to belong pushes us to craft ourselves based on how we perceive others' perceptions of us. Our thumbnails are continually edited to better fit our ideas of the norms and expectations of those around us. There's often a real disconnect between how people feel about us and how we think they do, and so the strange gap occurs where we shape ourselves to the expectations we perceive, while others perceive that we're changing in unexpected ways and often find ways to shape their expectations to accept us. We end up becoming people we don't necessarily want to be, nor do we become people that *others* necessarily want us to be, so who really benefits from these shifts? Any benefit or consequence happens as an unintended side-effect rather than as the main outcome. When we're aware of this effect, it's worth asking: Who do I really want to be, and how much of that desire is driven by what I think the world wants of me? Am I really sure that my idea of the world's desires for me is accurate? What exactly would I want for myself in the absence of any outside expectations? 

It's not necessarily that one's own expectations for themselves are inherently more correct than anyone else's expectations for them, it's just that the gap of interpretation and perception causes us to move further away from being true to ourselves the more that we change to fit in. We often underestimate the sheer depth of unconditional love and acceptance on offer in our relationships, and instead expect that belonging comes with sacrifice rather than with genuine commitment to being our best self rather than someone else's.
