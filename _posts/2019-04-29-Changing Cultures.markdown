Debates and arguments don't change cultures or minds. Our lizard brains love to argue and defend an opinion to the death, but that isn't what influences us to think differently. Common ground is built by the elements that link people together. Rather than bringing two people together of opposing political views to hash it out in the hopes of growth, a better first step is to bring them together on the basis of a shared love, like great food or books. People can't learn from each other as long as they lack empathy for the other party and consider them simply an opponent to be defeated. Once they both see each other as valuable human beings who share a common passion, that attitude shifts and true change can take place. This is how cultures are changed. It isn't force but an emotional tug that builds bonds and breaks down barriers.
