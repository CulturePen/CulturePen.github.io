There are a few interesting psychological reasons for why we find things cute and why they make us feel the way we do. Today I'm interested in how cuteness is meaningful to us and can give us insights into our empathetic and loving nature. While disgust has historically been a defensive emotional reaction, finding something cute is the opposite, almost an aspirational emotion rather than a self-preserving one. It makes us feel protective for something outside of ourselves and to feel more like sacrificing for its sake. In a way it's the same kind of aspirational emotion as our need to trust others even though we know that distrust has many rational benefits. Trust is a large part of what makes us human, in the same way that love does. That very human aspiration of risking a negative feeling in the form of rejection and failure and guilt in pursuit of one of connection has been very central to many of my thoughts lately. 

On the topic of love yesterday I delved a bit into how our egos interact with the way we love traditionally, the sliver of love that most of us know. In a way it's very easy for our ego to love cuteness and very easy for our ego to be disgusted by ugliness and asymmetry. What would it take to love the things we find visually displeasing as much as we love the things we find visually pleasing? If we imagine for a moment a world where we genuinely felt that kind of all-encompassing love, I think we get a peek into enlightenment and how it's been described by some. This dissolving of self and judgment and natural love for the universe and its beauty, including all the parts we often spurn like suffering and evil. Our words don't really do the experience justice as far as I can tell, but I wonder how an experience and state of being like this can be conveyed most aptly with our current tools of language and methods of transferring meaning.

We've been getting more creative with our tools and using complex forms of storytelling and evocative media forms (such as GIFs) to synthesize certain feelings such as empathy and then tie them back to the concept being described. It's utterly fascinating to me and I can't help but think that the more meaningfully accurate our forms of communication become, the closer we will get to open-minded absorption of conflicting perspectives. In a way it's part of why I think our cultural evolution into loving kittens online and posting cute media gives us a potential peek into the way our forms of communication are evolving to carry more emotion and feeling through to others in a way that's often pleasing to the receiver. I look forward to the ways we start to figure out to do the same for more challenging or less pleasing messages through the same form of evocative storytelling.
