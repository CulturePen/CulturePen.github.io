I can't overemphasize to myself the value of accepting personal agency enough. The amount of control I have over my life, regardless of circumstances, is astonishingly high. I still seem to operate by ideas of excuses and blame, but the quicker I learn to take personal responsibility and strive to be better, the better my life will be in any way I choose. I can't control external circumstances, and I can't always control my emotions or my reactions, but I can change them over time. I can shape my mind, through intentional practice and choice, to be more like the person I want to be. If I don't like what I want, I can change what I want. One challenge is changing habits I've built around seeking approval and trying to please everyone. It doesn't work, and neither does a complete insensitivity to what other people care about. Rather than vaccilating between extremes whenever I face problems with any one approach, I have to learn to change in balanced ways. And when circumstances push me to be someone I don't want to be, I should figure out what I really want. Do I want to change to fit those circumstances? Is that change making me a better person, or am I just doing it to survive? If I'm just doing it to survive, then I should start working towards getting out of those circumstances, or I should consider negotiating that expectation of change and exploring it. When I really consider the worst case scenarios of certain choices, they're quite minimal. As long as I replace things I dislike with any action or plan that I consider better, I can always find ways to make progress. There are very few irreversible decisions in life that cause irrevocable harm, even though in the moment I tend to think most decisions are like that.

It's difficult to know when a change is making me a better person or not, especially since I've come across so many different value systems that all seem valid to me. I've changed the values by which I operate so many times as I've learnt from different ideas that I don't really know who I am or what I want right right now, in this moment. My desires seem to be shaped in part by what I think other people around me want to hear, or what the person I'm talking to wants to hear. It's scary to notice this because that's never where I wanted to go or how I wanted to be. Even when I think I'm being completely honest with someone, I might later realize that I was lying to myself, and by extension lying to them. 

There's a series of choices that gets me anywhere I want to go. Many things are outside of my control, but my responses over time and adaptation to situations is very much in my control. There are patterns of difficulty and challenges, but I can always learn. This ability to learn is an investment worth making, since learning is so generally applicable. I can learn to change how I think, to change my circumstances, to take risks, and to practice something important to me over and over again. 

If instead, I make excuses whenever something seems difficult, I don't really learn anything. It's fine to drop certain things, but when I do that, I shouldn't have any excuses in mind. I should learn to either drop that goal or know that I'm switching to something easier that will help me do the more difficult thing later. Changing what I don't like might be very painful, but figuring out why it's painful when it actually is (rather than just imagining that it'll suck and not trying) will help me figure out how my own expectations and fears are holding me back.
