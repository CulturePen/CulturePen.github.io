Knowing more than someone else does not make your experiences more meaningful than theirs. This seems obvious, yet we act like this is false everyday. Minimizing the value of your own subjective experiences when you come across someone you respect who disagrees with you is making the same mistake. Someone being more successful, or smarter, or more fulfilled than you does not change the value of your perspective. Yet we implicitly respond like it does everytime we come across someone we perceive as smarter/dumber, happier/sadder, or even just more or less confident in their experiences than we are. If learning more about something makes you more certain, then you're learning only one half of the puzzle. To balance the knowledge that adds certainty, we must seek out the equally meaningful knowledge that fuels uncertainty and wonder. The more we come to know, the less we realize we know, and this is the key to infectious, contagious curiosity. It's fuelled almost entirely by the innate human desire for uncertain knowledge. 

We also often conflate knowledge with reality, when often knowledge is often based on newly formed beliefs based on subjective experiences. By being willing to question the certainty of our knowledge, we open ourselves up to the subjective experiences of others as much as our own.
