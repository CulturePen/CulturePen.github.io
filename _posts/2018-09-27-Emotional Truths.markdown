>*The real juice of life is emotional fitness.*

I've been grappling with this concept personally for a while now and never really felt like I had the words to describe it well. Here's an attempt at doing so. Have you ever had the feeling that bringing something up in a conversation or even just to yourself could be worse for you both than the very thing you're addressing? This feeling that giving it attention and naming it only serves to make it real, and that maybe if you can avoid thinking about it, it'll go away on its own. 

I've been on this journey to learn to be as honest with others as I am with myself, but quickly hit a wall when I realized how useless that would be if I was still constantly lying to myself. I think burying these emotional truths is one of the ways we get in our own way sometimes. It can be especially uncomfortable with others, but I've found myself deeply afraid of even being forthcoming about my motives with myself. For example, when I notice that I'm making a judgment of someone I'm talking to, my first instinct is to brush aside the awareness with the worry that if I spend more thought cycles on it, I would only strengthen its impact or effect on me. However, it soon became clear that suppressing it that way was only making it harder to actually resolve. 

So I tried something different and started to do the very thing that scared me most; I began saying it out loud, whether I was alone or speaking with an individual or a group, I just started blurting out things as soon as I could after realizing them. This led to some comical situations but in the long-term only served to deepen my relationships with others and myself. It was easiest to start with statements that encompassed everyone in the conversation, such as, "I feel like our egos are starting to get involved in this conversation and we're focusing too much on who's right rather than what's right."

But it got much harder when I had to call myself out for displaying traits that I was trying so hard to unlearn. The interesting thing that started to happen as I began calling myself out for prematurely judging people, or making assumptions or being too biased or focused on specific aspects of the conversation was that I started to become more aware of the root reasoning behind my snap instincts. Such as the realization that I have a bias towards science and rationalism because I grew up with sci-fi novels as a kid, but the bias goes so far that I hadn't been subjecting my logic to the same kind of stringent questioning to which I might subject something else like culture or spirituality. Somehow the moment I became deeply aware of that, the bias seemed to just vanish. Moreover, the guilt I had been carrying around for burying that bias for so long melted away too. I felt freer and more open to exploring other schools of thought and perspectives without feeling guilt or trepidation simply because I couldn't understand them through the self-limiting lens of science and "rationalism" that I had imposed upon myself. In a way, I became a much more rational person by simply acknowleding that rationality and skepticism should be just as subject to themselves as anything else, and that being human, the extent of my rationality will have very realistic limitations and flaws. 

It's starting to feel like self-awareness is a muscle that can be exercised and developed, rather than some arbitrary static extension of willpower that we're stuck with environmentally for the rest of our lives. The cultural conditioning I grew up with around willpower and discipline runs completely counter to the results of research today. I've known this for a long time intellectually, but it took a series of personal and meaningful experiences for me to emotionally internalize that information and overwrite my previous conditioning. I didn't even know that I been operating so defaultedly. I wonder what else I don't know I don't know about myself.
