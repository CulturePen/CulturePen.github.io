To build, to create: it can feel risky. We do it all the time of course, but to commit to it, to start a project and choose to build something that you might one day talk about or show someone... that can be scary. The first things we build are choices. Starting off as an unconscious rumbling, perhaps a mood or a feeling, forming itself into a thought or an action, and sometimes before we know it, we've made a choice. The choice to avoid something or face something. 

The choice to commit to something is a choice made now, to face any fear or self-doubt over and over in the future in the service of that commitment. It can be freeing. The choice to commit to avoiding something can be freeing too. To decide to structure a life that simply has no place for the things that don't matter to you. Easier said than done, but worth doing, and easier today for most of us than ever before.  

The shackles of waiting for the right moment to choose, the right moment commit... those shackles fall apart when we leap, when we choose, when we commit and move forward. Waiting for someone or some circumstance to unclasp those shackles is exactly what tightens them in place. Tightens us in place.
