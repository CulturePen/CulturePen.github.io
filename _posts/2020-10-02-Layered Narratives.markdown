The stories we tell ourselves and others take many forms. That Non-GMO, Gluten-free, Vegan, Non-Soy protein powder on a retail shelf tells a story. The layered narrative comes into play when someone digs deeper and the story beneath the story comes out.

People have layered narratives too. The stories we tell others and the stories we tell ourselves. Sometimes we dig deeper into our own stories and choose to unravel them, finding deeper narratives for who we are and why we are. I've been trying to figure out how to start to see some of the stories I've created to explain my flaws, since it's those stories that make it difficult to choose to improve different parts of myself. Finding the reason to make that choice is the first step to questioning and rewriting my own narrative to myself.
